# Parallel Processing Fix

## Problem Solved

The processing script now uses a single fixed parallel processing configuration (parallel_fixed) for all operations. All previous logic for profile selection, fallback, and switching has been removed.

## Solution Implemented

- Only one profile is available: parallel_fixed (10 workers, 0.0408s delay, 24.5 papers/sec)
- No more profile selection or switching
- All processing is parallel and rate-limited to 24.5 papers/sec

## How to Use

Just run the main processing scripts. No configuration or profile selection is needed.

## Expected Results

- Consistent, reliable parallel processing at the maximum safe rate for the API
