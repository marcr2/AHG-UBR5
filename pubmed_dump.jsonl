UBR5, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, has been consistently reported to be amplified and overexpressed in breast cancers.\nThis study analyzed 185 TNBC patients to investigate the association between UBR5 expression levels and clinical outcomes. Experimental approaches included in vitro assays using UBR5 knockout or knockdown TNBC cell models treated with doxorubicin and cisplatin, alongside in vivo xenograft models to assess therapeutic responses.\nHigh UBR5 expression correlated significantly with poor 5-year disease-free survival (44.0% vs. 82.0% in low UBR5 group) and reduced pathological complete response (pCR) rates to anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (8.8% vs. 33.3%). In vitro, UBR5 knockout or knockdown sensitized TNBC cells to doxorubicin and cisplatin, enhancing apoptosis and DNA damage accumulation, as evidenced by elevated γ-H2AX levels and impaired DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways, including ATM/CHK2 signaling and key repair proteins (53BP1, RAD51, BRCA1). Mechanistically, UBR5 loss suppressed p38/NF-κB signaling, further compromising DDR and exacerbating chemosensitivity. In vivo, UBR5-deficient xenografts exhibited enhanced doxorubicin responsiveness, an effect mimicked by p38 inhibition.\nUBR5 serves as a critical mediator of chemoresistance in TNBC by regulating the DNA damage response through the p38 signaling pathway.

Emerging evidence suggests the UBR-box family of E3 ubiquitin ligases (UBR1-7) are involved in the positive regulation of skeletal muscle mass. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of UBR-box E3 ubiquitin ligases under enhanced protein synthesis and skeletal muscle growth conditions. Cohorts of adult male mice were electroporated with constitutively active Akt (Akt-CA) or UBR5 RNAi constructs with a rapamycin diet intervention for 7 and 30 days, respectively. In addition, the UBR-box family was studied during the regrowth phase post nerve crush induced inactivity. Skeletal muscle growth with Akt-CA or regrowth following inactivity increased protein abundance of UBR1, UBR2, UBR4, UBR5 and UBR7. This occurred with corresponding increases in Akt-mTORC1/S6K and MAPK/p90RSK signaling and protein synthesis. The increases in UBR-box E3s, ubiquitination, and proteasomal activity occurred independently of mTORC1 activity and were associated with increases in markers related to autophagy, ER-stress, and protein quality control pathways. Finally, while UBR5 knockdown (KD) evokes atrophy, it occurs together with hyperactivation of mTORC1 and protein synthesis. In UBR5 KD muscles, we identified an increase in protein abundance for UBR2, UBR4 and UBR7, which may highlight a compensatory response to maintain proteome integrity. Future studies will seek to understand the role of UBR-box E3s towards protein quality control in skeletal muscle plasticity.\nNovel UBR-box E3 ubiquitin ligases are responsive to heightened protein synthesis and alterations in skeletal muscle mass and fiber size, in order to maintain proteome integrity.", "journal": "bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology", "date": "2025-08-08", "authors": ["Leslie MBaehr", "Luis GustavoOliveira de Sousa", "Craig AGoodman", "Adam PSharples", "David SWaddell", "Sue CBodine", "David CHughes"], "doi": "10.1101/2025.07.23.666188"}

Specific \"repair controllers\" that facilitate DNA repair pathway crosstalk between double-strand break (DSB) repair and base excision repair (BER) and that regulate BER protein engagement at lesion sites have yet to be identified. Here, we find that DNA polymerase β (Polβ), crucial for BER, is ubiquitylated in a BER complex-dependent manner by TRIP12, an E3 ligase that partners with UBR5 to restrain DSB repair signaling. Furthermore, we find that TRIP12, but not UBR5, controls cellular levels and chromatin loading of Polβ. Required for Polβ foci formation, TRIP12 influences Polβ involvement after radiation-induced DNA damage, a process regulated by TRIP12-mediated ubiquitylation of Polβ. Notably, excessive TRIP12-mediated engagement of Polβ affects DSB formation and radiation sensitivity, underscoring its role in promoting precedence for BER over DSB repair.

NETs play a key role in the pathological process of sepsis. However, the specific regulatory mechanism has not been fully clarified. This study finds that the levels of NETs in peripheral blood are significantly elevated in clinical sepsis patients and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) mouse models, and the expression of Acod1 is closely related to the generation of NETs. Acod1 knockout led to a further increase in NETs levels in CLP mice, aggravated the inflammatory response, worsened organ damage, and reduced the survival rate. Further studies indicate that E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5 interacts with PAD4 (one of the core proteins for NETs generation). Acod1/itaconate (ITA) enhanced the enzymatic activity of UBR5 through alkylation modification, promoting the K48-linked polyubiquitination and degradation of PAD4, thereby inhibiting NETosis.

HDAC6 removes the acetyl group of acetyllysine from histones to regulate gene expression in the nucleus. However, with predominant localization in the cytoplasm, various cytoplasmic substrates of HDAC6 have also been identified. HDAC6 is unique among the other 11 metal-dependent HDAC family members due to the presence of two independent and active deacetylase domains. Recently, an inactive mutant of HDAC6 has been used as a trap to discover substrates of the second catalytic domain (CD2). Here, substrates of the first catalytic domain (CD1) of HDAC6 were explored using trapping mutants and proteomics analysis, with 21 putative substrates identified. Among them, the E3 ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 was validated as a novel HDAC6 substrate. Specifically, E3 ligase HUWE1 was deacetylated by HDAC6 CD1 to elevate degradation activity. HDAC6 CD1 also regulated the protein levels of E3 ligase UBR5.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we established oxidative injury by treating astrocytes with corticosterone. Subsequently, PPARβ/δ agonists and antagonists were applied to determine the effects of PPARβ/δ on balancing peroxisomes and pexophagy in astrocytes. The PPARβ/δ agonist (GW0742) significantly improved cell viability and decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production induced by corticosterone, while pretreatment with the PPARβ/δ, antagonist GSK3787 reversed the effects of GW0742. Moreover, activating PPARβ/δ promoted peroxisomal biogenesis factor 5 (PEX5)-mediated pexophagy by enhancing the phosphorylation of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. Conversely, blocking PPARβ/δ with GSK3787 partially abolished the effects of GW0742. Further investigations demonstrated that activation of PPARβ/δ not only induced transcription of the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 5 (UBR5) but also enhanced the interaction between PPARβ/δ and UBR5, contributing to ATM interactor (ATMIN) degradation, and increased phosphorylated ATM kinase levels. Therefore, this study revealed that activating PPARβ/δ improves corticosterone-induced oxidative damage in astrocytes by enhancing pexophagy. PPARβ/δ directly interacts with UBR5 to facilitate ATMIN degradation and promotes ATM phosphorylation, thereby maintaining the balance between peroxisomes and pexophagy. These findings suggest that PPARβ/δ is a potential target for promoting pexophagy in astrocytes upon stress.", "journal": "Journal of neurochemistry", "date": "2025-02-08", "authors": ["JuanJi", "Ye-FanChen", "ChenHong", "Xue-WeiRen", "HangXu", "Zhen-YuCai", "Yin-FengDong", "Xiu-LanSun"], "doi": "10.1111/jnc.70013"}

The regulatory mechanisms of aberrant NAT10-mediated N4-acetylcytidine (ac4C) modifications in cancer progression remains poorly understood. Consequently, an integrated transcriptomic analysis is necessary to fully elucidate the role of NAT10-mediated ac4C modifications in CRC progression.\nNAT10 expression levels were analyzed in CRC samples and compared with those in corresponding normal tissues. The potential mechanisms of NAT10 in CRC were investigated using RNA sequencing, RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, and acetylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing. Additional in vivo and in vitro experiments, including CCK-8 assays, colony formation and mouse xenograft models, were conducted to explore the biological role of NAT10-mediated ac4C modifications. We also evaluated and optimized a potential treatment strategy targeting NAT10.\nWe found that NAT10 is highly expressed in CRC samples and plays a pro-oncogenic role. NAT10 knockdown led to PI3K-AKT pathway inactivation, thereby inhibiting CRC progression. However, treatment with the NAT10 inhibitor Remodelin induced only a limited and reversible growth arrest in CRC cells. Further epigenetic and transcriptomic analysis revealed that NAT10 enhances the stability of ERRFI1 mRNA by binding to its coding sequence region in an ac4C-dependent manner. NAT10 knockdown decreased ERRFI1 expression, which subsequently activated the EGFR pathway and counteracted the inhibitory effects on CRC. Based on these findings, we demonstrated that dual inhibition of NAT10 and EGFR using Remodelin and the EGFR-specific monoclonal antibody cetuximab resulted in improved therapeutic efficacy compared to either drug alone. Moreover, we observed that 5-Fluorouracil promoted the interaction between NAT10 and UBR5, which increased the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of NAT10, leading to ERRFI1 downregulation and EGFR reactivation. Triple therapy with Remodelin, cetuximab, and 5-Fluorouracil enhanced tumor regression in xenograft mouse models of CRC with wild-type KRAS, NRAS and BRAF.\nOur study elucidated the mechanism underlying 5-Fu-induced NAT10 downregulation, revealing that NAT10 inhibition destabilizes ERRFI1 mRNA through ac4C modifications, subsequently resulting in EGFR reactivation.

{"title": "UBR5 in Tumor Biology: Exploring Mechanisms of Immune Regulation and Possible Therapeutic Implications in MPNST.", "abstract": "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a rare but aggressive soft-tissue sarcoma characterized by poor response to therapy. The primary treatment remains surgical resection with negative margins. Nonetheless, in the setting of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), the five-year survival rate is at 20-50%, with recurrence occurring in up to 50% of individuals. For patients with metastatic and unresectable disease, current treatment options include cytotoxic chemotherapy, which offers minimal benefit, and most patients die within five years of diagnosis. Despite advances in targeted therapy focusing on inhibiting Ras signaling and its downstream effectors, clinical trials report minimal clinical benefit, highlighting the need to explore alternative pathways in MPNST pathogenesis. Here, we discuss the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, UBR5, in cancer progression and immune modulation across various malignancies, including breast, lung, and ovarian cancer. We focus on mechanisms by which UBR5 contributes to tumorigenesis, focusing on its influence on tumor microenvironment and immune modulation. Additionally, we explore UBR5's roles in normal tissue function, DNA damage response, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance, illustrating its multifaceted contribution to cancer biology. We discuss evidence implicating UBR5 in immune evasion and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy in MPNST, a tumor typically characterized by an immune cold microenvironment. We outline current immune-based strategies and challenges in MPNST management, ongoing efforts to shift the immune landscape in MPNST, and ultimately, we suggest that targeting UBR5 could be a novel strategy to potentiate ICB therapy-mediated anti-tumor immune response and clinical outcomes, particularly in MPNST patients with inoperable or metastatic disease.", "journal": "Cancers", "date": "2025-01-25", "authors": ["Diana AkinyiOdhiambo", "SelinaFan", "Angela CHirbe"], "doi": "10.3390/cancers17020161"}

Here, we report variants in the E3 ligase UBR5 in 29 individuals presenting with a neurodevelopmental syndrome that includes developmental delay, autism, intellectual disability, epilepsy, movement disorders, and/or genital anomalies. Their phenotype is distinct from JBS due to the absence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and the presence of autism, epilepsy, and, in some probands, a movement disorder. E3 ubiquitin ligases are responsible for transferring ubiquitin to substrate proteins to regulate a variety of cellular functions, including protein degradation, protein-protein interactions, and protein localization. Knocking out ubr-5 in C. elegans resulted in a lower movement score compared to the wild type, supporting a role for UBR5 in neurodevelopment. Using an in vitro autoubiquitination assay and confocal microscopy for the human protein, we found decreased ubiquitination activity and altered cellular localization in several variants found in our cohort compared to the wild type. In conclusion, we found that variants in UBR5 cause a neurodevelopmental syndrome that can be associated with a movement disorder, reinforcing the role of the UBR protein family in a neurodevelopmental disease that differs from previously described ubiquitin-ligase-related syndromes.

Paradoxically, UBR5 shields oxaliplatin-activated Smad3 from proteasome-dependent degradation via Lys 11-linked polyubiquitination. This novel chemical modification of Smad3 facilitates the transcriptional repression of ATF3, induction of SLC7A11 and inhibition of ferroptosis, contributing to chemoresistance.

However, the crucial proteins for modulating dynamic ER membrane curvature change that trigger pyroptosis are currently not well understood. In this study, a biotin-labeled chemical probe of potent pyroptosis inducer α-mangostin (α-MG) was synthesized. Through protein microarray analysis, reticulon-4 (RTN4/Nogo), a crucial regulator of ER membrane curvature, was identified as a target of α-MG. We observed that chemically induced proteasome degradation of RTN4 by α-MG through recruiting E3 ligase UBR5 significantly enhances the pyroptosis phenotype in cancer cells. Interestingly, the downregulation of RTN4 expression significantly facilitated a dynamic remodeling of ER membrane curvature through a transition from tubules to sheets, consequently leading to rapid fusion of the ER with the cell plasma membrane. In particular, the ER-to-plasma membrane fusion process is supported by the observed translocation of several crucial ER markers to the \"bubble\" structures of pyroptotic cells. Furthermore, α-MG-induced RTN4 knockdown leads to pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2)-dependent conventional caspase-3/gasdermin E (GSDME) cleavages for pyroptosis progression.

{"title": "E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5 promotes gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer by inducing O-GlcNAcylation-mediated EMT via destabilization of OGA.", "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is among the deadliest malignancies, with an extremely poor diagnosis and prognosis. Gemcitabine (GEM) remains the first-line drug for treating PC; however, only a small percentage of patients benefit from current immunotherapies or targeted therapies. Resistance to GEM is prevalent and affects long-term survival. We found that ubiquitin-protein ligase E3 module N-recognition 5 (UBR5) is a therapeutic target against GEM resistance. UBR5 was markedly upregulated in clinical GEM-resistant PC samples and GEM-resistant PC cells. UBR5 knockdown markedly increased GEM sensitivity in GEM-resistant PC cell lines. UBR5-mediated GEM resistance was accompanied by activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and could be mitigated by inhibiting EMT. Further analysis revealed that UBR5 promoted GEM resistance in PC cells by enhancing O-GlcNAcylation-mediated EMT. In addition, UBR5 knockdown resulted in increased O-GlcNAase (OGA) levels, an essential negatively regulated enzyme in the O-GlcNAcylation process. We identified a negative association between OGA and UBR5 levels, which further supported the hypothesis that O-GlcNAcylation-mediated GEM resistance induced by UBR5 is OGA-dependent in PC cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that UBR5 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase of OGA and regulates O-GlcNAcylation by binding and modulating OGA, facilitating its degradation and ubiquitination. Additionally, high-throughput compound library screening using three-dimensional protein structure analysis and drug screening identified a Food and Drug Administration drug, Y-39983 dihydrochloride, as a potent GEM sensitiser and UBR5 inhibitor. The combination of Y-39983 dihydrochloride and GEM attenuated tumour growth in a mouse xenograft tumour model. Collectively, these data demonstrated that UBR5 plays a pivotal role in the sensitisation of PC to GEM and provides a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome GEM resistance.", "journal": "Cell death & disease", "date": "2024-05-17", "authors": ["YunyanDu", "ZhangjianYang", "HaoShi", "ZhihanChen", "RongChen", "FanZhou", "XiaogangPeng", "TaoHong", "LipingJiang"], "doi": "10.1038/s41419-024-06729-z"}
{"title": "E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5 modulates circadian rhythm by facilitating the ubiquitination and degradation of the key clock transcription factor BMAL1.", "abstract": "The circadian clock is the inner rhythm of life activities and is controlled by a self-sustained and endogenous molecular clock, which maintains a ~ 24 h internal oscillation. As the core element of the circadian clock, BMAL1 is susceptible to degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Nevertheless, scant information is available regarding the UPS enzymes that intricately modulate both the stability and transcriptional activity of BMAL1, affecting the cellular circadian rhythm. In this work, we identify and validate UBR5 as a new E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with BMAL1 by using affinity purification, mass spectrometry, and biochemical experiments. UBR5 overexpression induced BMAL1 ubiquitination, leading to diminished stability and reduced protein level of BMAL1, thereby attenuating its transcriptional activity. Consistent with this, UBR5 knockdown increases the BMAL1 protein. Domain mapping discloses that the C-terminus of BMAL1 interacts with the N-terminal domains of UBR5. Similarly, cell-line-based experiments discover that HYD, the UBR5 homolog in Drosophila, could interact with and downregulate CYCLE, the BMAL1 homolog in Drosophila. PER2-luciferase bioluminescence real-time reporting assay in a mammalian cell line and behavioral experiments in Drosophila reveal that UBR5 or hyd knockdown significantly reduces the period of the circadian clock. Therefore, our work discovers a new ubiquitin ligase UBR5 that regulates BMAL1 stability and circadian rhythm and elucidates the underlying molecular mechanism.

Specific 'repair controllers' that facilitate DNA repair pathway crosstalk between double strand break (DSB) repair and base excision repair (BER), and regulate BER protein trafficking at lesion sites, have yet to be identified. We find that DNA polymerase β (Polβ), crucial for BER, is ubiquitylated in a BER complex-dependent manner by TRIP12, an E3 ligase that partners with UBR5 and restrains DSB repair signaling. Here we find that, TRIP12, but not UBR5, controls cellular levels and chromatin loading of Polβ. Required for Polβ foci formation, TRIP12 regulates Polβ involvement after DNA damage. Notably, excessive TRIP12-mediated shuttling of Polβ affects DSB formation and radiation sensitivity, underscoring its precedence for BER.

CAs have been used in the monitoring of persons exposed to genotoxic agents and radiation. Previous studies on occupationally exposed individuals have shown associations between the frequency of CAs in peripheral blood lymphocytes and subsequent cancer risk. The cause for CA formation is believed to be unrepaired or insufficiently repaired DNA double-strand breaks or other DNA damage, and additionally telomere shortening. CAs include chromosome (CSAs) and chromatid type aberrations (CTAs). In the present review, we first describe the types of CAs, the conventional techniques used for their detection and some aspects of interpreting the results. We then focus on germline genetic variation in the frequency and type of CAs measured in a genome-wide association study in healthy individuals in relation to occupational and smoking-related exposure compared to nonexposed referents.

Dedicated studies on 153 DNA repair genes showed associations for some 30 genes, the expression of which could be modified by the implicated variants.

Alterations from all omics were characterized, and prognostic models were established at the individual omics level and optimized at the multiomics level. All models were validated with a cohort of 99 patients with stages I-III GC.\nTTN, TP53, and MUC16 were among the genes with the highest mutational frequency, while UBR5, ZFHX4, PREX2, and ARID1A exhibited the most prominent copy number variations (CNVs). Upregulated COL10A1, CST1, and HOXC10 and downregulated GAST represented the biggest transcriptional alterations. Aberrant methylation of some well-known genes was revealed, including CLDN18, NDRG4, and SDC2. Many alterations were found to predict the patient prognosis by univariate analysis, while four mutant genes, two CNVs, five transcriptionally altered genes, and seven aberrantly methylated genes were identified as independent risk factors in multivariate analysis. Prognostic models at the single-omics level were established with these alterations, and optimized combination of selected alterations with clinicopathological factors was used to establish a final multiomics model. All single-omics models and the final multiomics model were validated by an independent cohort. The optimal area under the curve (AUC) was 0.73, 0.71, 0.71, and 0.85 for mutational, CNV, transcriptional, and methylation models, respectively.

Single-cell CRISPR screens in organoids could link genetic perturbations with parallel transcriptomic readout in single cells, providing a powerful method to delineate roles of cell fate regulators. However, a big challenge for identifying key regulators during data analysis is the low expression levels of transcription factors (TFs), which are difficult to accurately estimate due to noise and dropouts in single-cell sequencing. Also, it is often the changes in TF activities in the transcriptional cascade rather than the expression levels of TFs that are relevant to the cell fate transition.\nHere, we develop Organoid-based Single-cell CRISPR screening Analyzed with Regulons (OSCAR), a framework using regulon activities as readouts to dissect gene knockout effects in organoids. In adult-stem-cell-derived liver organoids, we map transcriptomes in 80,576 cells upon 246 perturbations associated with transcriptional regulation of hepatocyte formation. Using OSCAR, we identify known and novel positive and negative regulators, among which Fos and Ubr5 are the top-ranked ones. Further single-gene loss-of-function assays demonstrate that Fos depletion in mouse and human liver organoids promote hepatocyte differentiation by specific upregulation of liver metabolic genes and pathways, and conditional knockout of Ubr5 in mouse liver delays hepatocyte maturation.\nAltogether, we provide a framework to explore lineage specifiers in a rapid and systematic manner, and identify hepatocyte determinators with potential clinical applications.", "journal": "Genome biology", "date": "2023-11-01", "authors": ["JunboLiang", "JinsongWei", "JunCao", "JunQian", "RanGao", "XiaoyuLi", "DingdingWang", "YaniGu", "LeiDong", "JiaYu", "BingZhao", "XiaoyueWang"], "doi": "10.1186/s13059-023-03084-8"}

Heightened UBR5 expression plays a profound role in tumor growth through immune-dependent mechanisms; however, its mode of action in driving tumor metastasis has not been definitively delineated. Herein, we used a tetracycline (Tet)-inducible RNAi-mediated expression silencing cell system to investigate how UBR5 enables postsurgical mammary tumor metastatic growth in mouse lungs without the continuous influence of the primary lesion. In vitro, Ubr5 knockdown induces morphological and molecular changes characteristic of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In vivo, UBR5 promotes lung metastasis in an E3 ubiquitin ligase-dependent manner. Moreover, doxycycline-induced UBR5 expression knockdown in metastatic cells in the lungs, following removing the primary tumors, resulted in increased apoptosis, decreased proliferation and prolonged survival, whereas silencing the expression of cell division cycle 73 (CDC73), a tumor suppressor and E3 ligase substrate of UBR5, reversed these effects. Transcriptome analyses revealed a prominent role of the p53 pathway in dovitinib-induced apoptosis of tumor cells differentially regulated by UBR5 and CDC73. In human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patient specimens, a strong inverse correlation was observed between UBR5 and CDC73 protein levels, with reduced CDC73 expression at metastatic sites compared to primary lesions. Furthermore, a xenograft model of human TNBC recapitulated the metastatic properties and characteristics of the unique UBR5-CDC73 functional antagonism.

By rapidly turning over unpaired transcription factor subunits, UBR5 establishes dynamic interactions between transcriptional regulators that allow cells to effectively execute gene expression while remaining receptive to environmental signals.

Here, this work identifies cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) as a critical contributor to oxaliplatin resistance via in vitro and in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screening. CDK1 is highly expressed in oxaliplatin-resistant cells and tissues due to the loss of N6-methyladenosine modification. Genetic and pharmacological blockade of CDK1 restore the susceptibility of CRC cells to oxaliplatin in vitro and in cell/patient-derived xenograft models. Mechanistically, CDK1 directly binds to and phosphorylates Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family 4 (ACSL4) at S447, followed by recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5 and polyubiquitination of ACSL4 at K388, K498, and K690, which leads to ACSL4 protein degradation. Reduced ACSL4 subsequently blocks the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acid containing lipids, thereby inhibiting lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, a unique iron-dependent form of oxidative cell death. Moreover, treatment with a ferroptosis inhibitor nullifies the enhancement of CRC cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin by CDK1 blockade in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, the findings indicate that CDK1 confers oxaliplatin resistance to cells by suppressing ferroptosis. Therefore, administration of a CDK1 inhibitor may be an attractive strategy to treat patients with oxaliplatin-resistant CRC.", "journal": "Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)", "date": "2023-07-10", "authors": ["KaixuanZeng", "WeihaoLi", "YueWang", "ZifeiZhang", "LinjieZhang", "WeiliZhang", "YueXing", "ChiZhou"], "doi": "10.1002/advs.202301088"}

No single driver genetic lesion has been described to solely give rise to MCL. The hallmark translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) requires additional genetic alterations for the malignant transformation. A short list of recurrently mutated genes including ATM, CCND1, UBR5, TP53, BIRC3, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, and TRAF2 recently emerged as contributors to the pathogenesis of MCL. Notably, NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 were found to be mutated in multiple B cell lymphomas, including 5-10% of MCL, with most of these mutations occurring within the PEST domain of the protein. The NOTCH genes play a critical role in the early and late phases of normal B cell differentiation. In MCL, mutations in the PEST domain stabilize NOTCH proteins, rendering them resistant to degradation, which subsequently results in the upregulation of genes involved in angiogenesis, cell cycle progression, and cell migration and adhesion. At the clinical level, mutated NOTCH genes are associated with aggressive features in MCL, such as the blastoid and pleomorphic variants, a shorter response to treatment, and inferior survival.

In contrast to this functional understanding, we know far less about the assembly and turnover of the C9orf72-SMCR8 complex. Loss of either subunit causes the concurrent ablation of the respective partner. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this interdependence remains elusive. Here, we identify C9orf72 as a substrate of branched ubiquitin chain-dependent protein quality control. We find that SMCR8 prevents C9orf72 from rapid degradation by the proteasome.

Blocking ciRNA-Fmn1 downregulation reversed nerve-injury-induced reductions in both the binding of ciRNA-Fmn1 to the ubiquitin ligase UBR5 and the level of ubiquitination of albumin (ALB), thereby abrogating the nerve-injury-induced increase of ALB expression in the dorsal horn and attenuating the associated pain hypersensitivities. Conversely, mimicking downregulation of ciRNA-Fmn1 in naïve mice reduced the UBR5-controlled ubiquitination of ALB, leading to increased expression of ALB in the dorsal horn and induction of neuropathic-pain-like behaviors in naïve mice.

We validated through qRT-PCR that circMAN1A2 was highly expressed in NPC tissues and NPC cells. Survival analysis through Kaplan-Meier method showed that the overall survival, disease-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival of patients was negatively correlated with the expression of circMAN1A2. Then, gain- and loss-of function assays demonstrated that circMAN1A2 knockdown could impede the proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT in NPC cells.

Additionally, UBR5 interacted with ATMIN to foster the ubiquitination of ATMIN, thereby expediting the malignant behaviors of NPC cells as well as the lung and inguinal lymph node metastases of NPC tumors in vivo.

Knowing miRNA and its target genes gives a better understanding of the biological mechanism behind the development of breast cancer. Here, we evaluated the potential prognostic and predictive values of miRNAs in breast cancer development by analyzing Malay women with breast cancer expression profiles. Seven differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were subjected to miRNA‒target interaction network analysis (MTIN). A comprehensive MTIN was developed by integrating the information on miRNA and target gene interactions from five independent databases, including DIANA-TarBase, miRTarBase, miRNet, miRDB, and DIANA-microT. To understand the role of miRNAs in the progress of breast cancer, functional enrichment analysis of the miRNA target genes was conducted, followed by survival analysis to assess the prognostic values of the miRNAs and their target genes. In total, 1416 interactions were discovered among seven DEMs and 1274 target genes with a confidence score (CS) > 0.8. The overall survival analysis of the three most DEMs revealed a significant association of miR-27b-3p with poor prognosis in the TCGA breast cancer patient cohort. Further functional analysis of 606 miR-27b-3p target genes revealed their involvement in cancer-related processes and pathways, including the progesterone receptor signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt pathway, and EGFR transactivation. Notably, six high-confidence target genes (BTG2, DNAJC13, GRB2, GSK3B, KRAS, and UBR5) were discovered to be associated with worse overall survival in breast cancer patients, underscoring their essential roles in breast cancer development. Thus, we suggest that miR-27b-3p has significant potential as a biomarker for detecting breast cancer and can provide valuable understanding regarding the molecular mechanisms of the disease.", "journal": "International journal of molecular and cellular medicine", "date": "2023-01-01", "authors": ["Ab RashidJusoh", "Tengku Ahmad DamitriAl-Astani Bin Tengku Din", "Muhammad-RedhaAbdullah-Zawawi", "Wan Faiziah WanAbdul Rahman", "Siti Norasikin MohdNafi", "Roslaini CheRomli", "Ezzeddin Kamil MohamedHashim", "Mohd Nor AzimAb Patar", "Maya MazuwinYahya"], "doi": "10.22088/IJMCM.BUMS.12.3.257"}

The current treatment is suboptimal and a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease is required. In this study, we compared the proteogenomic analyses of LGSOCs from short- and long-term survivors (defined as < 40 and > 60 months, respectively). Our goal was to identify novel mutations, proteins, and mRNA transcripts that are dysregulated in LGSOC, particularly in short-term survivors.\nInitially, targeted sequencing of 409 cancer-related genes was performed on 22 LGSOC and 6 serous borderline ovarian tumor samples. Subsequently, whole-genome sequencing analysis was performed on 14 LGSOC samples (7 long-term survivors and 7 short-term survivors) with matched normal tissue samples. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), quantitative proteomics, and phosphoproteomic analyses were also performed.\nWe identified single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) (range: 5688-14,833 per sample), insertion and deletion variants (indels) (range: 880-1065), and regions with copy number variants (CNVs) (range: 62-335) among the 14 LGSOC samples. Among all SNVs and indels, 2637 mutation sites were found in the exonic regions. The allele frequencies of the detected variants were low (median12%). The identified recurrent nonsynonymous missense mutations included KRAS, NRAS, EIF1AX, UBR5, and DNM3 mutations. Mutations in DNM3 and UBR5 have not previously been reported in LGSOC. For the two samples, somatic DNM3 nonsynonymous missense mutations in the exonic region were validated using Sanger sequencing. The third sample contained two missense mutations in the intronic region of DNM3, leading to a frameshift mutation detected in RNA transcripts in the RNA-seq data. Among the 14 LGSOC samples, 7754 proteins and 9733 phosphosites were detected by global proteomic analysis. Some of these proteins and signaling pathways, such as BST1, TBXAS1, MPEG1, HBA1, and phosphorylated ASAP1, are potential therapeutic targets.\nThis is the first study to use whole-genome sequencing to detect somatic mutations in LGSOCs with matched normal tissues. We detected and validated novel mutations in DNM3, which were present in 3 of the 14 samples analyzed. Additionally, we identified novel indels, regions with CNVs, dysregulated mRNA, dysregulated proteins, and phosphosites that are more prevalent in short-term survivors.

{"title": "UBR5 Acts as an Antiviral Host Factor against MERS-CoV via Promoting Ubiquitination and Degradation of ORF4b.", "abstract": "Within the past 2 decades, three highly pathogenic human coronaviruses have emerged, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The health threats and economic burden posed by these tremendously severe coronaviruses have paved the way for research on their etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment. Compared to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV genome encoded fewer accessory proteins, among which the ORF4b protein had anti-immunity ability in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Our work for the first time revealed that ORF4b protein was unstable in the host cells and could be degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system. After extensive screenings, it was found that UBR5 (ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 5), a member of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligases, specifically regulated the ubiquitination and degradation of ORF4b. Similar to ORF4b, UBR5 can also translocate into the nucleus through its nuclear localization signal, enabling it to regulate ORF4b stability in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Through further experiments, lysine 36 was identified as the ubiquitination site on the ORF4b protein, and this residue was highly conserved in various MERS-CoV strains isolated from different regions. When UBR5 was knocked down, the ability of ORF4b to suppress innate immunity was enhanced and MERS-CoV replication was stronger. As an anti-MERS-CoV host protein, UBR5 targets and degrades ORF4b protein through the ubiquitin proteasome system, thereby attenuating the anti-immunity ability of ORF4b and ultimately inhibiting MERS-CoV immune escape, which is a novel antagonistic mechanism of the host against MERS-CoV infection.

Based on the screen, we identified PARP1, and six novel candidates associated with olaparib resistance upon knockout. For validation, we generated multiple knockout populations/clones per gene in C4 and/or LNCaP CRPC cells, which confirmed that loss of PARP1, ARH3, YWHAE, or UBR5 caused olaparib resistance. PARP1 or ARH3 knockout caused cross-resistance to other PARPis (veliparib and niraparib). Furthermore, PARP1 or ARH3 knockout led to reduced autophagy, while pharmacological induction of autophagy partially reverted their PARPi resistant phenotype. Tumor RNA sequencing of 126 prostate cancer patients identified low ARH3 expression as an independent predictor of recurrence.

Mounting evidence has shown that posttranslational protein modifications play vital roles in the DDR. In this study, we showed that deubiquitinase OTUD6A is involved in the DDR and is important for maintaining genomic stability. Mechanistically, in response to DNA damage, the abundance of OTUD6A was increased; meanwhile, PP2A interacted with OTUD6A and dephosphorylated OTUD6A at sites S70/71/74, which promoted nuclear localization of OTUD6A. Subsequently, OTUD6A was recruited to the damage site, where it interacted with TopBP1 and blocked the interaction between TopBP1 and its ubiquitin E3 ligase UBR5, decreasing K48-linked polyubiquitination and increasing the stability of TopBP1. OTUD6A depletion impaired CHK1 S345 phosphorylation and blocked cell cycle progression under DNA replication stress. Consistently, knockout of OTUD6A rendered mice hypersensitive to irradiation, shortened survival, and inhibited tumor growth by regulating TopBP1 in xenografted nude mice. Moreover, OTUD6A is expressed at high levels in breast cancer, and OTUD6A overexpression promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion, indicating that dysregulation of OTUD6A expression contributes to genomic instability and is associated with tumor development.

{"title": "UBR5 is a novel regulator of WNK1 stability.", "abstract": "The with no lysine (K) 1 (WNK1) protein kinase maintains cellular ion homeostasis in many tissues through actions on ion cotransporters and channels. Increased accumulation of WNK1 protein leads to pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHAII), a form of familial hypertension. WNK1 can be degraded via its adaptor-dependent recruitment to the Cullin3-RBX1 E3 ligase complex by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Disruption of this process also leads to disease. To determine if this is the primary mechanism of WNK1 turnover, we examined WNK1 protein stability and degradation by measuring its rate of decay after blockade of translation. Here, we show that WNK1 protein degradation exhibits atypical kinetics in HeLa cells. Consistent with this apparent complexity, we found that multiple degradative pathways can modulate cellular WNK1 protein amount. WNK1 protein is degraded by not only the proteasome but also the lysosome. Non-lysosomal cysteine proteases calpain and caspases also influence WNK1 degradation, as inhibitors of these proteases modestly increased WNK1 protein expression. Importantly, we discovered that the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5 interacts with WNK1 and its deficiency results in increased WNK1 protein. Our results further demonstrate that increased WNK1 in UBR5-depleted cells is attributable to reduced lysosomal degradation of WNK1 protein.

TRF2, however, also actively suppresses the cNHEJ pathway by recruiting two proteins, MRE11 and UBR5. MRE11 binds BRCC3, which in turn deubiquitinates γH2AX deposited at exposed telomeric DNA ends and limits RNF168 recruitment to the telomere. UBR5, in contrast directly ubiquitinates and destroys RNF168. The loss of telomeric RNF168 in turn blocks the subsequent recruitment of 53BP1 and prevents the cNHEJ-mediated fusion of chromosomes with exposed telomeric DNA ends. Although MRE11 and UBR5 are both involved in the control of telomeric RNF168 levels and the chromosome fusion process, their relative contributions have not been directly addressed. To do so we genetically suppressed MRE11 and UBR5 alone or in combination in glioma cell lines which we previously showed contained dysfunctional telomeres that were dependent on TRF2 for suppression of telomeric fusion and monitored the effects on events associated with telomere fusion. We here show that while suppression of either MRE11 or UBR5 alone had minimal effects on RNF168 telomeric accumulation, 53BP1 recruitment, and telomeric fusion, their combined suppression led to significant increases in RNF168 and 53BP1 telomeric recruitment and telomeric fusion and eventually cell death, all of which were reversible by suppression of RNF168 itself.

Luteolin (Lut) is a natural flavonoid with strong antitumor effects. However, the underlying mechanism(s) by which Lut protects against paclitaxel-resistant (PTX-resistant) cancer cell remains unknown. Herein, we found that Lut significantly attenuated the stem-like properties of PTX-resistant cancer cells by downregulating the expression of SOX2 protein. Additionally, further study showed that Lut could inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway to decrease the phosphorylation level of AKT(S473) and UBR5 expression, which is an ubiquitin E3 ligase that promotes SOX2 degradation. In addition, Lut also inhibited PTX-resistant cancer cell migration and invasion by blocking epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Importantly, Lut inhibited the tumorigenic ability of oesophageal PTX-resistant cancer cells and showed no obvious toxicity in vivo. Thus, Lut has potential as a promising agent for drug-resistant oesophageal cancer therapy.", "journal": "Pharmacological research", "date": "2021-10-17", "authors": ["JinzhuZhao", "LeileiLi", "ZhijiaWang", "LinlinLi", "MingjingHe", "ShuhuaHan", "YalongDong", "XiaojieLiu", "WenZhao", "YuKe", "CongWang"], "doi": "10.1016/j.phrs.2021.105939"}

Here, we find SIRT7 decline markedly attenuates the anti-tumor effect of IF. Mechanistically, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylating SIRT7 at T263 triggers further phosphorylation at T255/S259 by glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), which stabilizes SIRT7 by decoupling E3 ligase UBR5. SIRT7 hyperphosphorylation achieves anti-tumor activity by disrupting the SKP2-SCF E3 ligase, thus preventing SKP2-mediated K63-linked AKT polyubiquitination and subsequent activation. In contrast, GSK3β-SIRT7 axis is inhibited by EGF/ERK2 signaling, with ERK2 inactivating GSK3β, thus accelerating SIRT7 degradation. Unfavorably, glucose deprivation or chemotherapy hijacks the GSK3β-SIRT7 axis via ERK2, thus activating AKT and ensuring survival. Notably, Trametinib, an FDA-approved MEK inhibitor, enhances the efficacy of combination therapy with doxorubicin and IF.

Our findings revealed a role for UBR5 in maintaining cartilage homeostasis and suppressing metaplasia. Ubr5 loss of function resulted in progressive and dramatic articular cartilage degradation, enlarged, abnormally shaped sesamoid bones and extensive heterotopic tissue metaplasia linked to calcification of tendons and ossification of synovium. Genetic suppression of smoothened (Smo), a key mediator of HH signalling, dramatically enhanced the Ubr5 mutant phenotype.

However, direct inhibition of this class of proteins using conventional small molecules is challenging due to their intrinsically disordered state. To discover novel posttranslational regulators of MYC protein stability and turnover, we established a genetic screen in mammalian cells by combining a fluorescent protein-based MYC abundance sensor, CRISPR/Cas9-based gene knockouts and next-generation sequencing. Our screen identifies UBR5, an E3 ligase of the HECT-type family, as a novel regulator of MYC degradation. Even in the presence of the well-described and functional MYC ligase, FBXW7, UBR5 depletion leads to accumulation of MYC in cells. We demonstrate interaction of UBR5 with MYC and reduced K48-linked ubiquitination of MYC upon loss of UBR5 in cells. Interestingly, in cancer cell lines with amplified MYC expression, depletion of UBR5 resulted in reduced cell survival, as a consequence of MYC stabilization. Finally, we show that MYC and UBR5 are co-amplified in more than 40% of cancer cells and that MYC copy number amplification correlates with enhanced transcriptional output of UBR5.

Significantly mutated genes were NUDT5, ZBTB18, NEURL4, ZNF430, RBM44, GAK, PCDHA13, STK38 and UBR5. Besides, FAT1 gene was identified frequently mutated in anorectal melanoma patients (3/3, 100%). Moreover, our result showed that HPV infection may be associated with mucosal melanoma. In conclusion, this study indicated that mucosal melanomas have a low SNPs burden and a high number of CNVs and expand the spectrum of mucosal melanoma variants, also provided an insight for the pathological mechanism of mucosal melanoma.", "journal": "Annals of diagnostic pathology", "date": "2020-11-15", "authors": ["MingzhanDu", "YuhongWang", "DongmeiGu", "LingchuanGuo"], "doi": "10.1016/j.anndiagpath.2020.151648"}

While it thrives in a state of malnutrition, the mechanism by which pancreatic cancer cells adapt to metabolic stress through metabolic reprogramming remains unclear. Here, we showed that UBR5, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, was significantly upregulated in pancreatic cancer patient samples compared to the levels in adjacent normal tissues. Levels of UBR5 were closely related to a malignant phenotype and shorter survival among pancreatic cancer patients. Multivariate analyses also revealed that UBR5 overexpression was an independent predictor of poor outcomes among patients with pancreatic cancer. Functional assays revealed that UBR5 contributes to the growth of pancreatic cancer cells by inducing aerobic glycolysis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that UBR5 knockdown increased levels of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1), an important negative regulator in the process of aerobic glycolysis in many cancers. We found a significant negative correlation between levels of UBR5 and FBP1, further demonstrating that UBR5-induced aerobic glycolysis is dependent on FBP1 in pancreatic cancer cells. Mechanistically, UBR5 regulates FBP1 expression by modulating C/EBPα, directly binding to C/EBPα, and promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. Together, these results identify a mechanism used by pancreatic cancer cells to survive the nutrient-poor tumour microenvironment and also provide insight regarding the role of UBR5 in pancreatic cancer cell adaptation to metabolic stresses.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2020-10-31", "authors": ["LeifengChen", "RongfaYuan", "ChongyuWen", "TiandeLiu", "QianFeng", "XueqiangDeng", "YunyanDu", "XiaogangPeng"], "doi": "10.1038/s41388-020-01527-1"}

The precise mechanisms underpinning UBR5's role in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass remain unknown. The present study aimed to elucidate these mechanisms by silencing the UBR5 gene in vivo. To achieve this aim, we electroporated a UBR5-RNAi plasmid into mouse tibialis anterior muscle to investigate the impact of reduced UBR5 on anabolic signaling MEK/ERK/p90RSK and Akt/GSK3β/p70S6K/4E-BP1/rpS6 pathways. Seven days after UBR5 RNAi electroporation, although reductions in overall muscle mass were not detected, the mean cross-sectional area (CSA) of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive fibers were reduced (-9.5%) and the number of large fibers were lower versus the control. Importantly, UBR5-RNAi significantly reduced total RNA, muscle protein synthesis, ERK1/2, Akt, and GSK3β activity. Although p90RSK phosphorylation significantly increased, total p90RSK protein levels demonstrated a 45% reduction with UBR5-RNAi. Finally, these early events after 7 days of UBR5 knockdown culminated in significant reductions in muscle mass (-4.6%) and larger reductions in fiber CSA (-18.5%) after 30 days. This was associated with increased levels of phosphatase PP2Ac and inappropriate chronic elevation of p70S6K and rpS6 between 7 and 30 days, as well as corresponding reductions in eIF4e.

Monocytes and macrophages play an important role in CMV dissemination from the site of infection to target organs. Moreover, macrophages are specialized in pathogen sensing and respond to infection by secreting cytokines and interferons. In murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), a model for human cytomegalovirus, several genes required for efficient replication in macrophages have been identified, but their specific functions remain poorly understood. Here we show that MCMV m139, a gene of the conserved US22 gene family, encodes a protein that interacts with the DEAD box helicase DDX3, a protein involved in pathogen sensing and interferon (IFN) induction, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR5. DDX3 and UBR5 also participate in the transcription, processing, and translation of a subset of cellular mRNAs. We show that m139 inhibits DDX3-mediated IFN-α and IFN-β induction and is necessary for efficient viral replication in bone-marrow derived macrophages. In vivo, m139 is crucial for viral dissemination to local lymph nodes and to the salivary glands. An m139-deficient MCMV also replicated to lower titers in SVEC4-10 endothelial cells. This replication defect was not accompanied by increased IFN-β transcription, but was rescued by knockout of either DDX3 or UBR5. Moreover, m139 co-localized with DDX3 and UBR5 in viral replication compartments in the cell nucleus. These results suggest that m139 inhibits DDX3-mediated IFN production in macrophages and antagonizes DDX3 and UBR5-dependent functions related to RNA metabolism in endothelial cells.", "journal": "PLoS pathogens", "date": "2020-10-09", "authors": ["OlhaPuhach", "EleonoreOstermann", "ChristophKrisp", "GiadaFrascaroli", "HartmutSchlüter", "Melanie MBrinkmann", "WolframBrune"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.ppat.1008546"}

ATR activation requires the ATR activator, topoisomerase IIβ-binding protein 1 (TopBP1). However, the underlying mechanism of TopBP1 regulation and how its regulation affects DNA replication remain unknown. Here, we report a specific interaction between TopBP1 and the histone demethylase PHF8. The TopBP1/PHF8 interaction is mediated by the BRCT 7+8 domain of TopBP1 and phosphorylation of PHF8 at Ser854. This interaction is cell-cycle regulated and phosphorylation-dependent. PHF8 is phosphorylated by CK2, which regulates binding of PHF8 to TopBP1. Importantly, PHF8 regulates TopBP1 protein level by preventing its ubiquitination and degradation mediated by the E3 ligase UBR5. Interestingly, PHF8pS854 is likely to contribute to regulation of TopBP1 stability and DNA replication checkpoint. Further, both TopBP1 and PHF8 are required for efficient replication fork restart.

Hyd mediated Lys63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination of the NF-κB cofactor Akirin was required for efficient binding of Akirin to the NF-κB transcription factor Relish.

The difference between the normalized count of SC variants in the coding region and the normalized count of SC variants in the non-coding region should give a hint regarding the level of constraints for that gene in a specific population. This scoring system is negative when there are constraints that allow the presence of SC variants only in the non-coding region; on the contrary, it is positive when there are no constraints. A complimentary score is the sum of SC variants normalized count in both coding and non-coding regions, which could be used as a proxy of positive or strong purifying selection in a specific population. Our methodology showed a high level of constraining for genes such as USP34 in all subpopulations tested (1000 G dataset).

Bioinformatics analysis uncovered RAD50, MRE11, UBR5, MSH2, MSH6, DDB1, DDB2, RPA1, RBX1, CUL4A, and CUL4B mainly enriched in DNA damage repair related pathway and constituted a protein-protein interaction network. Ribosomal proteins were down-regulated. Cells were in a stress-responsive state, while the entire metabolic level was lowered. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: In U87 cell treated with TMZ for 1 week, which resulted in DNA damage, we found various proteins dysregulated in the nucleus. Some proteins related to the DNA damage repair pathway were up-regulated, and there was a strong interaction. We believe this is the potential clues of chemotherapy resistance in tumour cells. These proteins can be used as indicators of tumour resistance screening in the future.", "journal": "Cell biochemistry and function", "date": "2019-12-14", "authors": ["JinglinGuo", "Guo-ZhongYi", "ZhifengLiu", "XuegangSun", "RunweiYang", "ManlanGuo", "YaominLi", "KeLi", "KaishuLi", "XiranWang", "HaiminSong", "SongtaoQi", "GuanglongHuang", "YaweiLiu"], "doi": "10.1002/cbf.3459"}

Activation of PPARγ improves many of these mechanisms, although erroneous reports on potential adverse effects of thiazolidinedione (TZD)-class PPARγ agonists reduced their clinical use in the past decade. Here, we review recent findings in heart, lung, and kidney research related to the pathobiology of vascular remodeling and tissue fibrosis, and also potential therapeutic effects of the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone.\nIndependent of its metabolic effects (improved insulin sensitivity and fatty acid handling), PPARγ activation rescues BMPR2 dysfunction, inhibits TGFβ/Smad3/CTGF and TGFβ/pSTAT3/pFoxO1 pathways, and induces the PPARγ/apoE axis, inhibiting vascular remodeling. PPARγ activation dampens mtDNA damage via PPARγ/UBR5/ATM pathway, improves function of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and decrease renal fibrosis by repressing TGFβ/pSTAT3 and TGFβ/EGR1.\nPharmacological PPARγ activation improves many hallmarks of PAH, including dysfunction of BMPR2-PPARγ axis, PAEC, PASMC, EPC, mitochondria/metabolism, and inflammation.

Cancer-associated alterations often involve key players of DNA replication and of the DNA damage-signalling cascade. Post-translational modifications play a fundamental role in coordinating replication and repair and central among them is ubiquitylation. We show that the E3 ligase UBR5 interacts with components of the replication fork, including the translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerase polη. Depletion of UBR5 leads to replication problems, such as slower S-phase progression, resulting in the accumulation of single stranded DNA. The effect of UBR5 knockdown is related to a mis-regulation in the pathway that controls the ubiquitylation of histone H2A (UbiH2A) and blocking this modification is sufficient to rescue the cells from replication problems. We show that the presence of polη is the main cause of replication defects and cell death when UBR5 is silenced. Finally, we unveil a novel interaction between polη and H2A suggesting that UbiH2A could be involved in polη recruitment to the chromatin and the regulation of TLS.", "journal": "Nucleic acids research", "date": "2019-10-06", "authors": ["LinaCipolla", "FedericaBertoletti", "AntonioMaffia", "Chih-ChaoLiang", "Alan RLehmann", "Martin ACohn", "SimoneSabbioneda"], "doi": "10.1093/nar/gkz824"}

The E3 ubiquitin ligase EDD modifies substrate proteins through ubiquitination and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. However, its role in docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer is unknown. Here, we show that EDD is upregulated in docetaxel-resistant HRPC cells, as well as in human HRPC treated with docetaxel chemotherapy. Functionally, EDD knockdown resensitizes HRPC cells to docetaxel in vitro and in vivo, and in reverse, EDD overexpression promotes docetaxel resistance. We further show that the Wnt/β-Catenin signaling is activated in docetaxel-resistant HRPC cells, which can be promoted by EDD. Finally, inhibiting Wnt signaling through β-Catenin knockdown remarkably attenuates EDD-mediated docetaxel resistance, suggesting that the activated Wnt/β-Catenin signaling is a key contributor to EDD-conferred docetaxel resistance in HRPC cells. Altogether, our study uncovers a positive role of EDD in docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer, and further links it with the regulation of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling.", "journal": "Life sciences", "date": "2019-09-01", "authors": ["PanBian", "ZhonglingDou", "ZhaohuiJia", "WenshengLi", "DongPan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.lfs.2019.116816"}

Here, we define the protein interactome of UBR5 in ESCs and find interactions with distinct components of the H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex, which is required for proper maturation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Notably, loss of UBR5 induces an abnormal accumulation of rRNA processing intermediates, resulting in diminished ribosomal levels.

In the present study we extensively investigate this novel and uncharacterised E3 ubiquitin ligase (UBR5) in skeletal muscle atrophy, recovery from atrophy and injury, anabolism and hypertrophy. We demonstrated that UBR5 was epigenetically altered via DNA methylation during recovery from atrophy. We also determined that UBR5 was alternatively regulated versus well characterised E3 ligases, MuRF1/MAFbx, at the gene expression level during atrophy, recovery from atrophy and hypertrophy. UBR5 also increased at the protein level during recovery from atrophy and injury, hypertrophy and during human muscle cell differentiation. Finally, in humans, genetic variations of the UBR5 gene were strongly associated with larger fast-twitch muscle fibres and strength/power performance versus endurance/untrained phenotypes.\nWe aimed to investigate a novel and uncharacterized E3 ubiquitin ligase in skeletal muscle atrophy, recovery from atrophy/injury, anabolism and hypertrophy. We demonstrated an alternate gene expression profile for UBR5 vs. well characterized E3-ligases, MuRF1/MAFbx, where, after atrophy evoked by continuous-low-frequency electrical-stimulation in rats, MuRF1/MAFbx were both elevated, yet UBR5 was unchanged. Furthermore, after recovery of muscle mass post TTX-induced atrophy in rats, UBR5 was hypomethylated and increased at the gene expression level, whereas a suppression of MuRF1/MAFbx was observed. At the protein level, we also demonstrated a significant increase in UBR5 after recovery of muscle mass from hindlimb unloading in both adult and aged rats, as well as after recovery from atrophy evoked by nerve crush injury in mice. During anabolism and hypertrophy, UBR5 gene expression increased following acute loading in three-dimensional bioengineered mouse muscle in vitro, and after chronic electrical stimulation-induced hypertrophy in rats in vivo, without increases in MuRF1/MAFbx. Additionally, UBR5 protein abundance increased following functional overload-induced hypertrophy of the plantaris muscle in mice and during differentiation of primary human muscle cells. Finally, in humans, genetic association studies (>700,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms) demonstrated that the A alleles of rs10505025 and rs4734621 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the UBR5 gene were strongly associated with larger cross-sectional area of fast-twitch muscle fibres and favoured strength/power vs. endurance/untrained phenotypes. Overall, we suggest that: (i) UBR5 comprises a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase that is inversely regulated to MuRF1/MAFbx; (ii) UBR5 is epigenetically regulated; and (iii) UBR5 is elevated at both the gene expression and protein level during recovery from skeletal muscle atrophy and hypertrophy.", "journal": "The Journal of physiology", "date": "2019-05-17", "authors": ["Robert ASeaborne", "David CHughes", "Daniel CTurner", "Daniel JOwens", "Leslie MBaehr", "PiotrGorski", "Ekaterina ASemenova", "Oleg VBorisov", "Andrey KLarin", "Daniil VPopov", "Edward VGenerozov", "HazelSutherland", "Ildus IAhmetov", "Jonathan CJarvis", "Sue CBodine", "Adam PSharples"], "doi": "10.1113/JP278073"}

SOX2 overexpression occurs more broadly in cancer than gene amplification, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here we showed that in esophageal cancer cell lines the levels of SOX2 proteins are not directly correlated to the copy numbers of SOX2 genes and are strongly influenced by proteostasis. We showed that AKT is a major determinant for SOX2 overexpression and does so by protecting SOX2 from ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. We identified UBR5 as a major ubiquitin E3 ligase that induces SOX2 degradation through ubiquitinating SOX2 at lysine 115. Phosphorylation of SOX2 at threonine 116 by AKT inhibits the interaction of UBR5 with SOX2 and thus stabilizes SOX2. We provided evidence that AKT inhibitor can effectively downregulate SOX2 and suppress esopheageal cancer cell proliferation and stemness.

OTUD5 localizes to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), interacts with UBR5 and represses the RNA Pol II elongation and RNA synthesis. OTUD5 co-localizes and interacts with the FACT component SPT16 and antagonizes the histone H2A deposition at DSB lesions. OTUD5 interacts with UBR5 and SPT16 independently through two distinct regions, and both interactions are necessary for arresting the Pol II elongation at lesions. These analyses suggested that the catalytic (through UBR5 stabilization) as well as scaffolding (through FACT binding) activities of OTUD5 are involved in the FACT-dependent transcription.

We show that the mutant mice die around embryonic days 9.5-10.5 (E9.5-E10.5) associated with abnormalities in various developmental processes such as neurogenesis and cardiovascular development. These developmental defects are significantly attributed to the inability to maintain cell integrity and adhesion, which significantly correlates to the severity of null phenotypes. UBR4-loss induces the depletion of many, but not all, proteins from the plasma membrane, suggesting that UBR4 is involved in proteome-wide turnover of cell surface proteins. Indeed, UBR4 is associated with and required to generate the multivesicular body (MVB) which transiently store endocytosed cell surface proteins before their targeting to autophagosomes and subsequently lysosomes.

As such, iPSCs suppress the aggregation of polyQ-expanded huntingtin (HTT), the mutant protein underlying Huntington's disease (HD). Here we show that proteasome activity determines HTT levels, preventing polyQ-expanded aggregation in iPSCs from HD patients (HD-iPSCs). iPSCs exhibit high levels of UBR5, a ubiquitin ligase required for proteasomal degradation of both normal and mutant HTT. Conversely, loss of UBR5 increases HTT levels and triggers polyQ-expanded aggregation in HD-iPSCs. Moreover, UBR5 knockdown hastens polyQ-expanded aggregation and neurotoxicity in invertebrate models. Notably, UBR5 overexpression induces polyubiquitination and degradation of mutant HTT, reducing polyQ-expanded aggregates in HD-cell models. Besides HTT levels, intrinsic enhanced UBR5 expression determines global proteostasis of iPSCs preventing the aggregation of misfolded proteins ensued from normal metabolism.

GRWD1 acts as a tumor-promoting factor by downregulating p53 (also known as TP53) via the RPL11-MDM2-p53 axis. Here, we identified GRWD1-interacting proteins using a proteomics approach and showed that GRWD1 interacts with various proteins involved in transcription, translation, DNA replication and repair, chromatin organization, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. We focused on the ribosomal protein ribosomal protein L23 (RPL23), which positively regulates nucleolar stress responses through MDM2 binding and inhibition, thereby functioning as a tumor suppressor. Overexpression of GRWD1 decreased RPL23 protein levels and stability; this effect was restored upon treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. EDD (also known as UBR5), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with GRWD1, also downregulated RPL23, and the decrease was further enhanced by co-expression of GRWD1. Conversely, siRNA-mediated GRWD1 knockdown upregulated RPL23. Co-expression of GRWD1 and EDD promoted RPL23 ubiquitylation. These data suggest that GRWD1 acts together with EDD to negatively regulate RPL23 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

PP1 gains substrate specificity through binding to a large number (>200) of regulatory proteins that control PP1 localization, activity, and interactions with substrates. PP1 recognizes the well-characterized RVxF binding motif that is present in many of these regulatory proteins, thus generating a multitude of distinct PP1 holoenzymes. We showed that a subset of the RVxF binding motifs, in which x is a phosphorylatable amino acid (RV[S/T]F), was phosphorylated specifically during mitosis and that this phosphorylation event abrogated the interaction of PP1 with the regulatory protein. We determined that this phosphorylation was primarily governed by the mitotic protein kinase Aurora B and that high phosphorylation site stoichiometry of these sites maintained the phosphorylation of PP1 substrates during mitosis by disrupting the assembly of PP1 holoenzymes. We generated an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the RV[S/T]F motif (RVp[S/T]F) and used it to identify known PP1 regulatory proteins (KNL1, CDCA2, and RIF1) and multiple proteins that could potentially act as PP1 binding partners (UBR5, ASPM, SEH1, and ELYS) governed by this mechanism.

We validated the effect of UBR5 depletion on primary cilia formation using a robust model of ciliogenesis, and identified CSPP1, a centrosomal and ciliary protein required for cilia formation, as a UBR5-interacting protein. We show that UBR5 ubiquitylates CSPP1, and that UBR5 is required for cytoplasmic organization of CSPP1-comprising centriolar satellites in centrosomal periphery, suggesting that UBR5-mediated ubiquitylation of CSPP1 or associated centriolar satellite constituents is one underlying requirement for cilia expression.

HOXA9 itself is a potent oncogene resulting in myeloid leukemia when overexpressed, which is strongly accelerated by its collaborator Meis1. HOX, PBX1 and MEIS1 proteins have been shown to form hetero dimeric or trimeric complexes in different combinations. Cooperative interaction between PBX1 and HOX proteins enhances their DNA binding specificity, essential for HOX dependent developmental programs. PBX1 is retained in E2A-PBX1, and thus the strong transcriptional activator properties of E2A-PBX1 may lead to aberrant activation of normally repressed targets of HOX-PBX complexes.

BMI1 also participates in gene silencing during DNA damage response, but the precise downstream function of BMI1 in gene silencing is unclear. Here we identified the UBR5 E3 ligase as a downstream factor of BMI1. We found that UBR5 forms damage-inducible nuclear foci in a manner dependent on the PRC1 components BMI1, RNF1 (RING1a), and RNF2 (RING1b). Whereas transcription is repressed at UV-induced lesions on chromatin, depletion of the PRC1 members or UBR5 alone derepressed transcription elongation at these sites, suggesting that UBR5 functions in a linear pathway with PRC1 in inducing gene silencing at lesions. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis revealed that UBR5 associates with BMI1 as well as FACT components SPT16 and SSRP1. We found that UBR5 localizes to the UV-induced lesions along with SPT16. We show that UBR5 ubiquitinates SPT16, and depletion of UBR5 or BMI1 leads to an enlargement of SPT16 foci size at UV lesions, suggesting that UBR5 and BMI1 repress SPT16 enrichment at the damaged sites. Consistently, depletion of the FACT components effectively reversed the transcriptional derepression incurred in the UBR5 and BMI1 KO cells. Finally, UBR5 and BMI1 KO cells are hypersensitive to UV, which supports the notion that faulty RNA synthesis at damaged sites is harmful to the cell fitness.

The E3 ligase UBR5 (also known as EDD1) is essentially involved in diverse types of cancer. Here we aimed to study the functions of UBR5 in human gastric cancer. We first analyzed the mRNA and protein levels of UBR5 in human gastric cancer tissues and the results showed that UBR5 was markedly increased in gastric cancer tissues compared with normal gastric mucosa or matched non-cancer gastric tissues. The relationship between UBR5 and survival of gastric cancer patients was analyzed and we found that high UBR5 expression was associated with poor overall and disease-free survival. We further tried to investigate the effects of UBR5 on gastric cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we knocked down UBR5 with lentivirus-mediated shRNA and found that UBR5 knockdown repressed in vitro proliferation and colony formation of gastric cancer cells AGS, MG803 and MNK1. In vivo xenograft experiment also demonstrated that UBR5 knockdown inhibited AGS growth. Finally, we explored the mechanism by which UBR5 contributed to the growth of gastric cancer cells. We found that UBR5 bound the tumor suppressor gastrokine 1 (GKN1) and increased its ubiquitination to reduce the protein stability of GKN1. GKN1 knockdown with lentivirus-mediated shRNA increased the in vitro colony formation and in vivo growth of AGS cells, and UBR5 knockdown was unable to affect the colony formation and in vivo growth of AGS cells when GKN1 was knocked down, indicating that GKN1 contributed to the effects of UBR5 in human gastric cancer cells.

While much is known about the events within a Hh-stimulated cell, far less is known about the regulation of Hh-ligand production. Drosophila Hyperplastic Discs (Hyd), a ubiquitin-protein ligase, represents one of the few non-transcription factors that independently regulates both hh mRNA expression and pathway activity. Using a murine embryonic stem cell system, we revealed that shRNAi of the mammalian homologue of hyd, Ubr5, effectively prevented retinoic-acid-induced Sonic hedgehog (Shh) expression. We next investigated the UBR5:Hh signalling relationship in vivo by generating and validating a mouse bearing a conditional Ubr5 loss-of-function allele. Conditionally deleting Ubr5 in the early embryonic limb-bud mesenchyme resulted in a transient decrease in Indian hedgehog ligand expression and decreased Hh pathway activity, around E13.5. Although Ubr5-deficient limbs and digits were, on average, shorter than control limbs, the effects were not statistically significant. Hence, while loss of UBR5 perturbed Hedgehog signalling in the developing limb, there were no obvious morphological defects. In summary, we report the first conditional Ubr5 mutant mouse and provide evidence for a role for UBR5 in influencing Hh signalling, but are uncertain to whether the effects on Hedgehog signaling were direct (cell autonomous) or indirect (non-cell-autonomous).

In humans, reduced or inappropriate Notch signaling activity is associated with various developmental defects and disease states, including cancers. Caenorhabditis elegans expresses two Notch-type receptors, GLP-1 and LIN-12. GLP-1 mediates several cell-signaling events in the embryo and promotes germline proliferation in the developing and adult gonad. LIN-12 acts redundantly with GLP-1 in certain inductive events in the embryo and mediates several cell-cell interactions during larval development. Recovery of genetic suppressors and enhancers of glp-1 or lin-12 loss- or gain-of-function mutations has identified numerous regulators of GLP-1 and LIN-12 signaling activity. Here, we report the molecular identification of sog-1, a gene identified in screens for recessive suppressors of conditional glp-1 loss-of-function mutations. The sog-1 gene encodes UBR-5, the sole C. elegans member of the UBR5/Hyd family of HECT-type E3 ubiquitin ligases. Molecular and genetic analyses indicate that the loss of ubr-5 function suppresses defects caused by reduced signaling via GLP-1 or LIN-12. In contrast, ubr-5 mutations do not suppress embryonic or larval lethality associated with mutations in a downstream transcription factor, LAG-1. In the gonad, ubr-5 acts in the receiving cells (germ cells) to limit GLP-1 signaling activity.

The UPS is disrupted in many diseases including cancer, and targeting the UPS for cancer therapy is gaining wide interest. E3 ubiquitin ligases occupy a key position in the hierarchical UPS enzymatic cascade, largely responsible for determining substrate specificity and ubiquitin (Ub) chain topology. The E3 ligase UBR5 (aka EDD1) is emerging as a key regulator of the UPS in cancer and development. UBR5 expression is deregulated in many cancer types and UBR5 is frequently mutated in mantle cell lymphoma. UBR5 is highly conserved in metazoans, has unique structural features, and has been implicated in regulation of DNA damage response, metabolism, transcription, and apoptosis. Hence, UBR5 is a key regulator of cell signaling relevant to broad areas of cancer biology. However, the mechanism by which UBR5 may contribute to tumor initiation and progression remains poorly defined. This review synthesizes emerging insights from genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology to inform our understanding of UBR5 in cancer. These molecular insights indicate a role for UBR5 in integrating/coordinating various cellular signaling pathways.

TIP60 protein expression is reduced in cancers. In cervical cancers, human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 oncogene targets cellular p53, Bak and some of the PDZ domain-containing proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation through E6AP ligase. Recently, E6 oncogene from high-risk and low-risk categories was also shown to target TIP60. However, the molecular mechanisms and whether destabilization of TIP60 contributes to HPV E6-mediated transformation remain unanswered. Our proteomic analyses revealed EDD1 (E3 identified by differential display), an E3 ligase generally overexpressed in cancers as a novel interacting partner of TIP60. By investigating protein turnover and ubiquitination assays, we show that EDD1 negatively regulates TIP60's stability through the proteasome pathway. Strikingly, HPV E6 uses this function of EDD1 to destabilize TIP60. Colony-formation assays and soft agar assays show that gain of function of TIP60 or depletion of EDD1 in HPV-positive cervical cancer cells significantly inhibits cell growth in vitro. This phenotype is strongly supported by the in-vivo studies where re-activation of TIP60 in cervical cancer cells dramatically reduces tumor formation. In summary, we have discovered a novel ligase through which E6 destabilizes TIP60. Currently, in the absence of an effective therapeutic vaccine for malignant cervical cancers, cervical cancer still remains to be a major disease burden. Hence, our studies implying a distinct tumor suppressor role for TIP60 in cervical cancers show that reactivation of TIP60 could be of therapeutic value.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "2015-08-04", "authors": ["V KSubbaiah", "YZhang", "DRajagopalan", "L NAbdullah", "N S LYeo-Teh", "VTomaić", "LBanks", "M PMyers", "E KChow", "SJha"], "doi": "10.1038/onc.2015.268"}

{"title": "Stability of the human pregnane X receptor is regulated by E3 ligase UBR5 and serine/threonine kinase DYRK2.", "abstract": "The hPXR (human pregnane X receptor), a major chemical toxin sensor, is a ligand-induced transcription factor activated by various xenobiotics and toxins, resulting in the transcriptional up-regulation of detoxifying enzymes. To date, little is known about the upstream regulation of hPXR. Using MS analysis and a kinome-wide siRNA screen, we report that the E3 ligase UBR5 (ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 5) and DYRK2 (dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 2) regulate hPXR stability. UBR5 knockdown resulted in accumulation of cellular hPXR and a concomitant increase in hPXR activity, whereas the rescue of UBR5 knockdown decreased the cellular hPXR level and activity. Importantly, UBR5 exerted its effect in concert with the serine/threonine kinase DYRK2, as the knockdown of DYRK2 phenocopied UBR5 knockdown. hPXR was shown to be a substrate for DYRK2, and DYRK2-dependent phosphorylation of hPXR facilitated its subsequent ubiquitination by UBR5. This is the first report of the post-translational regulation of hPXR via phosphorylation-facilitated ubiquitination by DYRK2 and UBR5. The results of the present study reveal the role of the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway in modulating hPXR activity and indicate that pharmacological inhibitors of the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway that regulate hPXR stability may negatively affect treatment outcome from unintended hPXR-mediated drug-drug interactions.", "journal": "The Biochemical journal", "date": "2014-01-21", "authors": ["Su SienOng", "Asli NGoktug", "AyeshaElias", "JingWu", "DarrenSaunders", "TaoshengChen"], "doi": "10.1042/BJ20130558"}
{"title": "EDD enhances cell survival and cisplatin resistance and is a therapeutic target for epithelial ovarian cancer.", "abstract": "The E3 ubiquitin ligase EDD is overexpressed in recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancers, suggesting a role in tumor survival and/or platinum resistance. EDD knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) induced apoptosis in A2780ip2, OVCAR5 and ES-2 ovarian cancer cells, correlating with loss of the prosurvival protein myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1) through a glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta-independent mechanism. SiRNA to EDD or Mcl-1 induced comparable levels of apoptosis in A2780ip2 and ES-2 cells. Stable overexpression of Mcl-1 protected cells from apoptosis following EDD knockdown, accompanied by a loss of endogenous, but not exogenous, Mcl-1 protein, suggesting that EDD regulated Mcl-1 synthesis. Indeed, EDD knockdown induced a 1.87-fold decrease in Mcl-1 messenger RNA and EDD transfection enhanced murine Mcl-1 promoter-driven luciferase expression 5-fold. To separate EDD survival and potential cisplatin resistance functions, we generated EDD shRNA stable cell lines that could survive initial EDD knockdown and showed that these cells were 4- to 21-fold more sensitive to cisplatin. Moreover, transient EDD overexpression in COS-7 cells was sufficient to promote cisplatin resistance 2.4-fold, dependent upon its E3 ligase activity. In vivo, mouse intraperitoneal ES-2 and A2780ip2 xenograft experiments showed that mice treated with EDD siRNA by nanoliposomal delivery [1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phophatidylcholine (DOPC)] and cisplatin had significantly less tumor burden than those treated with control siRNA/DOPC alone (ES-2, 77.9% reduction, P = 0.004; A2780ip2, 75.9% reduction, P = 0.042) or control siRNA/DOPC with cisplatin in ES-2 (64.4% reduction, P = 0.035), with a trend in A2780ip2 (60.3% reduction, P = 0.168).

It encodes a highly conserved and predominantly nuclear ubiquitin E3 ligase of the HECT family, with potential multifunctional roles in development and tumorigenesis. In this study, we further examined the largely uncharacterized role of EDD in transcriptional regulation by uncovering the spectrum of its direct target genes at a genome-wide level. Use of a systematic approach that integrates gene expression and chromatin binding profiling identified several candidate EDD-target genes, one of which is ACVRL1, a TGF-β receptor with functional implications in blood vessel development. Further characterization revealed a negative regulation of ACVRL1 gene expression by EDD that is exerted at the promoter. Consistent with the aberrant upregulation of ACVRL1 and downstream Smad signaling, abrogation of EDD led to deregulated vessel development and endothelial cell motility. Collectively, these results extended the known cellular roles of EDD to critical functions in transcriptional regulation as well as angiogenesis, and may provide mechanistic explanations for EDD's tumorigenic and developmental roles.", "journal": "Biochimica et biophysica acta", "date": "2013-11-06", "authors": ["Hui-WenChen", "Chang-ChingYang", "Chia-LingHsieh", "HsuanLiu", "Sheng-ChungLee", "Bertrand Chin-MingTan"], "doi": "10.1016/j.bbagrm.2013.10.006"}

{"title": "Structure of the HHARI catalytic domain shows glimpses of a HECT E3 ligase.", "abstract": "The ubiquitin-signaling pathway utilizes E1 activating, E2 conjugating, and E3 ligase enzymes to sequentially transfer the small modifier protein ubiquitin to a substrate protein. During the last step of this cascade different types of E3 ligases either act as scaffolds to recruit an E2 enzyme and substrate (RING), or form an ubiquitin-thioester intermediate prior to transferring ubiquitin to a substrate (HECT). The RING-inBetweenRING-RING (RBR) proteins constitute a unique group of E3 ubiquitin ligases that includes the Human Homologue of Drosophila Ariadne (HHARI). These E3 ligases are proposed to use a hybrid RING/HECT mechanism whereby the enzyme uses facets of both the RING and HECT enzymes to transfer ubiquitin to a substrate. We now present the solution structure of the HHARI RING2 domain, the key portion of this E3 ligase required for the RING/HECT hybrid mechanism. The structure shows the domain possesses two Zn²⁺-binding sites and a single exposed cysteine used for ubiquitin catalysis. A structural comparison of the RING2 domain with the HECT E3 ligase NEDD4 reveals a near mirror image of the cysteine and histidine residues in the catalytic site. Further, a tandem pair of aromatic residues exists near the C-terminus of the HHARI RING2 domain that is conserved in other RBR E3 ligases. One of these aromatic residues is remotely located from the catalytic site that is reminiscent of the location found in HECT E3 enzymes where it is used for ubiquitin catalysis. These observations provide an initial structural rationale for the RING/HECT hybrid mechanism for ubiquitination used by the RBR E3 ligases.", "journal": "PloS one", "date": "2013-09-24", "authors": ["Donald ESpratt", "PascalMercier", "Gary SShaw"], "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0074047"}

The substrate recognition and ubiquitin transfer activities of the E3 ligase may be mediated by a single polypeptide or may rely on separate subunits. The latter organization is particularly prevalent among members of largest class of E3 ligases, the RING family, although examples of this type of arrangement have also been reported among members of the smaller HECT family of E3 ligases. This review describes recent discoveries that reveal the surprising and distinctive ability of VprBP (DCAF1) to serve as a substrate recognition subunit for a member of both major classes of E3 ligase, the RING-type CRL4 ligase and the HECT-type EDD/UBR5 ligase. The cellular processes normally regulated by VprBP-associated E3 ligases, and their targeting and subversion by viral accessory proteins are also discussed.

Paradoxically, while PABP accumulation promotes human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) protein synthesis, we show that this is accompanied by an analogous increase in the abundance of Paip2 and EDD1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that destabilizes Paip2. Coordinate control of PABP1, Paip2, and EDD1 required the virus-encoded UL38 mTORC1 activator and resulted in augmented Paip2 synthesis, stability, and association with PABP1. Paip2 synthesis also increased following serum stimulation of uninfected normal fibroblasts, suggesting that this coregulation may play a role in how uninfected cells respond to stress. Significantly, Paip2 accumulation was dependent on PABP accrual, as preventing PABP1 accumulation suppressed viral replication and inhibited the corresponding Paip2 increase. Furthermore, depleting Paip2 restored the ability of infected cells to assemble the translation initiation factor eIF4F, promoting viral protein synthesis and replication without increasing PABP1. This establishes a new role for the cellular PABP1 inhibitor Paip2 as an innate defense that restricts viral protein synthesis and replication. Moreover, it illustrates how a stress-induced rise in PABP1 triggered by virus infection can counter and surpass a corresponding increase in Paip2 abundance and stability.", "journal": "Genes & development", "date": "2013-08-22", "authors": ["CalebMcKinney", "DongYu", "IanMohr"], "doi": "10.1101/gad.221341.113"}

The development and stepwise progression of NPC involves accumulation of multiple gross genetic changes during the clonal expansion of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected nasopharyngeal epithelial cell population. Here, using paired-end whole-transcriptome sequencing, we discovered a number of chimeric fusion transcripts in a panel of EBV-positive tumour lines. Among these transcripts, a novel fusion of ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 5 (UBR5) on 8q22.3 and zinc finger protein 423 (ZNF423) on 16q12.1, identified from the NPC cell line C666-1, was recurrently detected in 12/144 (8.3%) of primary tumours. The fusion gene contains exon 1 of UBR5 and exons 7-9 of ZNF423 and produces a 94 amino acid chimeric protein including the original C-terminal EBF binding domain (ZF29-30) of ZNF423. Notably, the growth of NPC cells with UBR5-ZNF423 rearrangement is dependent on expression of this fusion protein. Knock-down of UBR5-ZNF423 by fusion-specific siRNA significantly inhibited the cell proliferation and colony-forming ability of C666-1 cells. The transforming ability of UBR5-ZNF423 fusion was also confirmed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Constitutive expression of UBR5-ZNF423 in NIH3T3 fibroblasts significantly enhanced its anchorage-independent growth in soft agar and induced tumour formation in a nude mouse model. These findings suggest that expression of UBR5-ZNF423 protein might contribute to the transformation of a subset of NPCs, possibly by altering the activity of EBFs (early B cell factors).

{"title": "Seasonal and regional differences in gene expression in the brain of a hibernating mammal.", "abstract": "Mammalian hibernation presents a unique opportunity to study naturally occurring neuroprotection. Hibernating ground squirrels undergo rapid and extreme physiological changes in body temperature, oxygen consumption, and heart rate without suffering neurological damage from ischemia and reperfusion injury. Different brain regions show markedly different activity during the torpor/arousal cycle: the cerebral cortex shows activity only during the periodic returns to normothermia, while the hypothalamus is active over the entire temperature range. Therefore, region-specific neuroprotective strategies must exist to permit this compartmentalized spectrum of activity. In this study, we use the Illumina HiSeq platform to compare the transcriptomes of these two brain regions at four collection points across the hibernation season: April Active, October Active, Torpor, and IBA. In the cerebral cortex, 1,085 genes were found to be differentially expressed across collection points, while 1,063 genes were differentially expressed in the hypothalamus. Comparison of these transcripts indicates that the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus implement very different strategies during hibernation, showing less than 20% of these differentially expressed genes in common. The cerebral cortex transcriptome shows evidence of remodeling and plasticity during hibernation, including transcripts for the presynaptic cytomatrix proteins bassoon and piccolo, and extracellular matrix components, including laminins and collagens. Conversely, the hypothalamic transcriptome displays upregulation of transcripts involved in damage response signaling and protein turnover during hibernation, including the DNA damage repair gene RAD50 and ubiquitin E3 ligases UBR1 and UBR5. Additionally, the hypothalamus transcriptome also provides evidence of potential mechanisms underlying the hibernation phenotype, including feeding and satiety signaling, seasonal timing mechanisms, and fuel utilization.

Substrates carrying N-degrons are recognized by N-recognins that mediate ubiquitylation-dependent selective proteolysis through the proteasome. Our previous studies identified the mammalian N-recognin family consisting of UBR1/E3α, UBR2, UBR4/p600, and UBR5, which recognize destabilizing N-terminal residues through the UBR box. In the current study, we addressed the physiological function of a poorly characterized N-recognin, 570-kDa UBR4, in mammalian development. UBR4-deficient mice die during embryogenesis and exhibit pleiotropic abnormalities, including impaired vascular development in the yolk sac (YS). Vascular development in UBR4-deficient YS normally advances through vasculogenesis but is arrested during angiogenic remodeling of primary capillary plexus associated with accumulation of autophagic vacuoles. In the YS, UBR4 marks endoderm-derived, autophagy-enriched cells that coordinate differentiation of mesoderm-derived vascular cells and supply autophagy-generated amino acids during early embryogenesis. UBR4 of the YS endoderm is associated with a tissue-specific autophagic pathway that mediates bulk lysosomal proteolysis of endocytosed maternal proteins into amino acids. In cultured cells, UBR4 subpopulation is degraded by autophagy through its starvation-induced association with cellular cargoes destined to autophagic double membrane structures. UBR4 loss results in multiple misregulations in autophagic induction and flux, including synthesis and lipidation/activation of the ubiquitin-like protein LC3 and formation of autophagic double membrane structures.

{"title": "A two-step mechanism for TRF2-mediated chromosome-end protection.", "abstract": "Mammalian telomeres repress DNA-damage activation at natural chromosome ends by recruiting specific inhibitors of the DNA-damage machinery that form a protective complex termed shelterin. Within this complex, TRF2 (also known as TERF2) has a crucial role in end protection through the suppression of ATM activation and the formation of end-to-end chromosome fusions. Here we address the molecular properties of TRF2 that are both necessary and sufficient to protect chromosome ends in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Our data support a two-step mechanism for TRF2-mediated end protection. First, the dimerization domain of TRF2 is required to inhibit ATM activation, the key initial step involved in the activation of a DNA-damage response (DDR). Next, TRF2 independently suppresses the propagation of DNA-damage signalling downstream of ATM activation. This novel modulation of the DDR at telomeres occurs at the level of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168 (ref. 3). Inhibition of RNF168 at telomeres involves the deubiquitinating enzyme BRCC3 and the ubiquitin ligase UBR5, and is sufficient to suppress chromosome end-to-end fusions.

Dyrk2 phosphorylates TERT protein, a catalytic subunit of telomerase. Phosphorylated TERT is then associated with the EDD-DDB1-VprBP E3 ligase complex for subsequent ubiquitin-mediated TERT protein degradation. During the cell cycle, Dyrk2 interacts with TERT at the G2/M phase and induces degradation.

It is not well understood either how Msp58 mediates its myriad functions or how it is itself regulated. Here, by immunoprecipitation, we identify EDD (E3 identified by differential display) as a novel Msp58-interacting protein. EDD, also called UBR5, is a HECT-domain (homologous to E6-AP carboxy-terminus) containing ubiquitin ligase that plays a role in cell proliferation, differentiation and DNA damage response. Both in vitro and in vivo binding assays show that Msp58 directly interacts with EDD. Microscopy studies reveal that these two proteins co-localize in the nucleus. We have also found that depletion of EDD leads to an increase of Msp58 protein level and extends the half-life of Msp58, demonstrating that EDD negatively regulates Msp58's protein stability. Furthermore, we show that Msp58 is upregulated in multiple different cell lines upon the treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 and exogenously expressed Msp58 is ubiquitinated, suggesting that Msp58 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Finally, knockdown of either Msp58 or EDD in human lung fibroblast WI-38 cells affects the levels of cyclins B, D and E, as well as cell cycle progression. Together, these results suggest a role for the Msp58/EDD interaction in controlling cell cycle progression.

In ubiquitination cascades involving E3s of the HECT class, ubiquitin is transferred from an associated E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme to the acceptor cysteine of the HECT domain, which consists of structurally distinct N- and C-lobes connected by a flexible linker. Here, the high-resolution crystal structure of the C-lobe of the HECT domain of human UBR5 is presented. The structure reveals important features that are unique compared with other HECT domains. In particular, a distinct four-residue insert in the second helix elongates this helix, resulting in a strikingly different orientation of the preceding loop. This protruding loop is likely to contribute to specificity towards the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBCH4, which is an important functional partner of UBR5. Ubiquitination assays showed that the C-lobe of UBR5 is able to form a thioester-linked E3-ubiquitin complex, although it does not physically interact with UBCH4 in NMR experiments.

Here, we show that TRIP12 and UBR5, two HECT domain ubiquitin E3 ligases, control accumulation of RNF168, a rate-limiting component of a pathway that ubiquitylates histones after DNA breakage. We find that RNF168 can be saturated by increasing amounts of DSBs. Depletion of TRIP12 and UBR5 allows accumulation of RNF168 to supraphysiological levels, followed by massive spreading of ubiquitin conjugates and hyperaccumulation of ubiquitin-regulated genome caretakers such as 53BP1 and BRCA1. Thus, regulatory and proteolytic ubiquitylations are wired in a self-limiting circuit that promotes histone ubiquitylation near the DNA lesions but at the same time counteracts its excessive spreading to undamaged chromosomes.

Although they share many enzymes, these two processes are not simply the reverse of each other and are instead reciprocally regulated. Two key enzymes that regulate irreversible steps in these two processes are pyruvate kinase (PK) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxy kinase (PEPCK), which catalyze the last and first step of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, respectively, and are both regulated by lysine acetylation. Acetylation at Lys305 of the PKM (muscle form of PK) decreases its activity and also targets it for chaperone-mediated autophagy and subsequent lysosome degradation. Acetylation of PEPCK, on the other hand, targets it for ubiquitylation by the HECT E3 ligase, UBR5/EDD1, and subsequent proteasomal degradation. These studies established a model in which acetylation regulates metabolic enzymes via different mechanisms and also revealed cross talk between acetylation and ubiquitination.

Here, we show that acetylation regulates the stability of the gluconeogenic rate-limiting enzyme PEPCK1, thereby modulating cellular response to glucose. High glucose destabilizes PEPCK1 by stimulating its acetylation. PEPCK1 is acetylated by the P300 acetyltransferase, and this acetylation stimulates the interaction between PEPCK1 and UBR5, a HECT domain containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, therefore promoting PEPCK1 ubiquitinylation and degradation.

Previous study has also shown that EDD can act as a transcription cofactor independently of its E3 ligase activity. In this study, we uncover a new role for EDD during cell cycle progression in an E3 ligase-independent manner. We demonstrate that EDD can physically interact with p53 and that this interaction blocks the phosphorylation of p53 by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). Silencing of EDD induces phosphorylation of p53 at Ser(15) and activates p53 target genes in fibroblasts and some transformed cells without activation of DNA damage response. The G(1)/S arrest induced by EDD depletion depends on p53. On the other hand, overexpression of EDD inhibits p53-Ser(15) phosphorylation and suppresses the induction of p53 target genes during DNA damage, and this effect does not require its E3 ligase activity.

In the case of p53, this is mediated principally by the E6AP ubiquitin ligase. Several studies have reported that E6 can target certain of its substrates in an apparently E6AP-independent fashion and that several of these substrates vary in the degree to which they are degraded by E6 at different stages of malignancy. To more fully understand the regulation of the E6AP/E6 proteolytic targeting complex, we performed a mass spectroscopic analysis of HPV type 18 (HPV-18) E6 protein complexes and identified the HECT domain-containing ubiquitin ligase EDD as a new HPV-18 E6 binding partner. We show that EDD can interact independently with both E6 and E6AP. Furthermore, EDD appears to regulate E6AP expression levels independently of E6, and loss of EDD stimulates the proteolytic activity of the E6/E6AP complex. Conversely, higher levels of EDD expression protect a number of substrates from E6-induced degradation, partly as a consequence of lower levels of E6 and E6AP expression. Intriguingly, reduction in EDD expression levels in HPV-18-positive HeLa cells enhances cell resistance to apoptotic and growth arrest stimuli. These studies suggest that changes in the levels of EDD expression during different stages of the viral life cycle or during malignancy could have a profound effect upon the ability of E6 to target various substrates for proteolytic degradation and thereby directly influence the development of HPV-induced malignancy.", "journal": "Journal of virology", "date": "2011-01-14", "authors": ["VjekoslavTomaic", "DavidPim", "MirandaThomas", "PaolaMassimi", "Michael PMyers", "LawrenceBanks"], "doi": "10.1128/JVI.02004-10"}

TFIIS also binds UBR5 to stimulate CDK9 polyubiquitination. Co-localization of UBR5, CDK9, and TFIIS along specific regions of the γ fibrinogen (γFBG) gene indicates that a ternary complex involving these factors participates in the transcriptional regulation of this gene. In support of this notion, overexpression of TFIIS not only modifies the ubiquitination pattern of CDK9 in vivo but also increases the association of CDK9 with various regions of the γFBG gene. Notably, the TFIIS-mediated increase in CDK9 loading is obtained during both basal and activated transcription of the γFBG gene. This increased CDK9 binding is paralleled by an increase in the recruitment of RNAPII along the γFBG gene and the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of the RNAPII largest subunit RPB1 on Ser-2, a known target of CDK9.

We used a yeast two-hybrid screen with myocardin as bait to search for factors that may regulate the transcriptional activity of the myocardin. From this screen we identified a HECT domain-containing protein UBR5 (ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component n-recognin 5) as a myocardin-binding protein. Previous studies have shown that HECT domain-containing proteins are ubiquitin E3 ligases that play an important role in protein degradation. UBR5 has, however, also been shown to regulate transcription independent of its E3 ligase activity. In the current study we demonstrated that UBR5 localized in the nuclei of SMCs and forms a complex with myocardin in vivo and in vitro. We also show that UBR5 specifically enhanced trans-activation of smooth muscle-specific promoters by the myocardin family of proteins. In addition, UBR5 significantly augmented the ability of myocardin to induce expression of endogenous SMC marker genes independent on its E3 ligase function. Conversely, depletion of endogenous UBR5 by small interfering RNA in fibroblast cells attenuated myocardin-induced smooth muscle-specific gene expression, and UBR5 knockdown in SMCs resulted in down-regulation of smooth muscle-specific genes. Furthermore, we found that UBR5 can attenuate myocardin protein degradation resulting in increased myocardin protein expression without affecting myocardin mRNA expression.

We propose a model where the 70-residue UBR box functions as a common structural element essential for binding to all known destabilizing N-terminal residues, whereas specific residues localized in the UBR box (for type 1) or the N-domain (for type 2) provide substrate selectivity through interaction with the side group of an N-terminal amino acid.

We have previously shown that the E3 ubiquitin ligase, EDD, a regulator of DNA damage responses, is amplified and overexpressed in serous ovarian carcinoma. Given that DNA damage pathways are linked to platinum resistance, the aim of this study was to determine if EDD expression was associated with disease recurrence and platinum sensitivity in serous ovarian cancer. High nuclear EDD expression, as determined by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 151 women with serous ovarian carcinoma, was associated with an approximately two-fold increased risk of disease recurrence and death in patients who initially responded to first-line chemotherapy, independently of disease stage and suboptimal debulking. Although EDD expression was not directly correlated with relative cisplatin sensitivity of ovarian cancer cell lines, sensitivity to cisplatin was partially restored in platinum-resistant A2780-cp70 ovarian cancer cells following siRNA-mediated knockdown of EDD expression.

The N-end rule pathway is a ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent proteolytic system in which specific E3s, called N-recognins, mediate ubiquitylation through the recognition of types 1 and 2, destabilizing N-terminal residues of substrates. We recently identified a set of E3 Ub ligases (named UBR1-UBR7) containing the 70-residue UBR box, and we demonstrated that UBR1, UBR2, UBR4, and UBR5 can bind to destabilizing N-terminal residues. To explore a model of heterovalent interaction to the N-recognin family, we synthesized the small-molecule compound RF-C11, which bears two heterovalent ligands designed to target N-recognins, together with control molecules with two homovalent ligands. We demonstrate that heterovalent ligands of RF-C11 selectively and cooperatively bind cognate-binding sites of multiple N-recognins and thereby inhibit both types 1 and 2 N-end rule activities. Furthermore, the efficacy of heterovalent RF-C11 was substantially higher than homovalent inhibitors, which can target either a type 1 or type 2 site, providing the molecular basis of designing multivalent inhibitors for the control of specific intracellular pathways. In addition, RF-C11 exhibited higher efficacy and stability, compared with dipeptides bearing destabilizing N-terminal residues, which are known competitive inhibitors of the pathway. We also used the heterovalent compound to study the function of N-recognins in cardiac signaling.

Here, we demonstrate that EDD is necessary for G(1)/S and intra S phase DNA damage checkpoint activation and for the maintenance of G(2)/M arrest after double strand DNA breaks. Defective checkpoint activation in EDD-depleted cells led to radio-resistant DNA synthesis, premature entry into mitosis, accumulation of polyploid cells, and cell death via mitotic catastrophe. In addition to decreased CHK2 activation in EDD-depleted cells, the expression of several key cell cycle mediators including Cdc25A/C and E2F1 was altered, suggesting that these checkpoint defects may be both CHK2-dependent and -independent.

In the 129SvImJ background, UBR3-/- mice died during embryogenesis, whereas the C57BL/6 background UBR3-/- mice exhibited neonatal lethality and suckling impairment that could be partially rescued by litter size reduction. The adult UBR3-/- mice had female-specific behavioral anosmia. Cells of the olfactory pathway were found to express beta-galactosidase (LacZ) that marked the deletion/disruption UBR3- allele. The UBR3-specific LacZ expression was also prominent in cells of the touch, vision, hearing, and taste systems, suggesting a regulatory role of UBR3 in sensory pathways, including olfaction.

Here, we describe a close interplay between PABP and Paip2 protein levels in the cell. We demonstrate a mechanism for this co-regulation that involves an E3 ubiquitin ligase, EDD, which targets Paip2 for degradation. PABP depletion by RNA interference (RNAi) causes co-depletion of Paip2 protein without affecting Paip2 mRNA levels. Upon PABP knockdown, Paip2 interacts with EDD, which leads to Paip2 ubiquitination. Supporting a critical role for EDD in Paip2 degradation, knockdown of EDD expression by siRNA leads to an increase in Paip2 protein stability. Thus, we demonstrate that the turnover of Paip2 in the cell is mediated by EDD and is regulated by PABP.

NMR chemical shift perturbations were used to map the peptide-binding site in the PABC domain of HYD. The structural features of binding are very similar to those of the interactions with the domain of PABP, which explains the overlapping peptide specificity and binding affinity.

Mutation of one or more of these residues generates a \"pocket\" in the ATP binding site that allows the mutant kinase, but not other cellular kinases, to utilize analogs of ATP with bulky substituents synthesized onto the N-6 position.

Ubiquitination is mediated by ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (UBCs or E2s), and ubiquitin protein ligases (E3s). Since we previously showed that the activated ubiquitination is UBC4 dependent, we characterized Rat100, a UBC4-dependent E3 expressed in the testis. Analysis of expressed sequence tag sequences and immunoblotting showed that Rat100 is actually a 300-kDa protein expressed mainly in the brain and testis and is similar to the human E3 identified by differential display (EDD) protein and the Drosophila hyperplastic discs gene, mutants of which cause a defect in spermatogenesis. Rat100 is induced during postnatal development of the rat testis, peaking at d 25. It is localized only in germ cells and is highly expressed in spermatocytes, moderately in round and slightly in elongating spermatids. In contrast to UBC4 whose removal from a testis extract abrogates much of the conjugation activity, immmunodepletion of Rat100 from the extracts had little effect. Rat100 therefore has a limited subset of substrates, some of which appear associated with the E3 as the immunoprecipitate containing Rat100 supported incorporation of (125)I-ubiquitin into high molecular weight proteins. Thus, Rat100 is the homolog of human EDD and likely of Drosophila hyperplastic discs. This homology, together with our results, suggests that induction of this E3 results in ubiquitination of specific substrates, some of which are important in male germ cell development.", "journal": "Endocrinology", "date": "2002-09-20", "authors": ["RoseOughtred", "NathalieBedard", "Olasunkanmi A JAdegoke", "Carlos RMorales", "JacquettaTrasler", "VenkateshRajapurohitam", "Simon SWing"], "doi": "10.1210/en.2002-220262"}
{"title": "EDD, the human hyperplastic discs protein, has a role in progesterone receptor coactivation and potential involvement in DNA damage response.", "abstract": "The ubiquitin-protein ligase EDD encodes an orthologue of the hyperplastic discs tumor suppressor gene, which has a critical role in Drosophila development. Frequent allelic imbalance at the EDD chromosomal locus in human cancers suggests a role in tumorigenesis. In addition to a HECT (homologous to E6-AP carboxyl terminus) domain, the EDD protein contains a UBR1 zinc finger motif and ubiquitin-associated domain, each of which indicates involvement in ubiquitinylation pathways. This study shows that EDD interacts with importin alpha 5 through consensus basic nuclear localization signals and is localized in cell nuclei. EDD also binds progesterone receptor (PR) and potentiates progestin-mediated gene transactivation. This activity is comparable with that of the coactivator SRC-1, but, in contrast, the interaction between EDD and PR does not appear to involve an LXXLL receptor-binding motif. EDD also binds calcium- and integrin-binding protein/DNA-dependent protein kinase-interacting protein, a potential target of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and an altered association is found between EDD and calcium- and integrin-binding protein/DNA-dependent protein kinase-interacting protein in response to DNA damage. The data presented here demonstrate a role for EDD in PR signaling but also suggest a link to cancer through DNA damage response pathways.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2002-05-16", "authors": ["Michelle JHenderson", "Amanda JRussell", "SamanthaHird", "MarciaMuñoz", "Jennifer LClancy", "Gillian MLehrbach", "Sophina TCalanni", "David AJans", "Robert LSutherland", "Colin K WWatts"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M203527200"}
{"title": "Cooperation of HECT-domain ubiquitin ligase hHYD and DNA topoisomerase II-binding protein for DNA damage response.", "abstract": "Ubiquitin ligases define the substrate specificity of protein ubiquitination and subsequent proteosomal degradation. The catalytic sequence was first characterized in the C terminus of E6-associated protein (E6AP) and referred to as the HECT (homologous to E6AP C terminus) domain. The human homologue of the regulator of cell proliferation hyperplastic discs in Drosophila, designated hHYD, is a HECT-domain ubiquitin ligase. Here we show that hHYD provides a ubiquitin system for a cellular response to DNA damage. A yeast two-hybrid screen showed that DNA topoisomerase IIbeta-binding protein 1 (TopBP1) interacted with hHYD. Endogenous hHYD bound the BRCA1 C-terminus domains of TopBP1 that are highlighted in DNA damage checkpoint proteins and cell cycle regulators. Using an in vitro reconstitution, specific E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating) enzymes (human UbcH4, UbcH5B, and UbcH5C) transferred ubiquitin molecules to hHYD, leading to the ubiquitination of TopBP1. TopBP1 was usually ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteosome, whereas X-irradiation diminished the ubiquitination of TopBP1 probably via the phosphorylation, resulting in the stable colocalization of up-regulated TopBP1 with gamma-H2AX nuclear foci in DNA breaks. These results demonstrated that hHYD coordinated TopBP1 in the DNA damage response.", "journal": "The Journal of biological chemistry", "date": "2001-11-21", "authors": ["YoshiomiHonda", "MasahideTojo", "KazuhitoMatsuzaki", "TadashiAnan", "MitsuhiroMatsumoto", "MasayukiAndo", "HideyukiSaya", "MitsuyoshiNakao"], "doi": "10.1074/jbc.M104347200"}
{"title": "X-ray structure of the human hyperplastic discs protein: an ortholog of the C-terminal domain of poly(A)-binding protein.", "abstract": "The poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) recognizes the 3' mRNA poly(A) tail and plays an essential role in eukaryotic translation initiation and mRNA stabilization/degradation. PABP is a modular protein, with four N-terminal RNA-binding domains and an extensive C terminus. The C-terminal region of PABP is essential for normal growth in yeast and has been implicated in mediating PABP homo-oligomerization and protein-protein interactions. A small, proteolytically stable, highly conserved domain has been identified within this C-terminal segment. Remarkably, this domain is also present in the hyperplastic discs protein (HYD) family of ubiquitin ligases. To better understand the function of this conserved region, an x-ray structure of the PABP-like segment of the human HYD protein has been determined at 1.04-A resolution. The conserved domain adopts a novel fold resembling a right-handed supercoil of four alpha-helices. Sequence profile searches and comparative protein structure modeling identified a small ORF from the Arabidopsis thaliana genome that encodes a structurally similar but distantly related PABP/HYD domain. Phylogenetic analysis of the experimentally determined (HYD) and homology modeled (PABP) protein surfaces revealed a conserved feature that may be responsible for binding to a PABP interacting protein, Paip1, and other shared interaction partners.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "date": "2001-04-05", "authors": ["R CDeo", "NSonenberg", "S KBurley"], "doi": "10.1073/pnas.071552198"}
{"title": "Xenopus Xenf: an early endodermal nuclear factor that is regulated in a pathway distinct from Sox17 and Mix-related gene pathways.", "abstract": "We report a novel zygotic gene encoding a Xenopus endodermal nuclear factor, Xenf. Expression of Xenf starts at the late blastula stages and is decreased after gastrulation. Xenf shows no structural homology to any known proteins. When GFP-tagged Xenf is overexpressed in Xenopus cells, Xenf protein is localized to the nucleus, associating closely with the chromosomes. In animal cap assays, Xenf expression is strongly activated by mRNA injection of Vg1 and VegT, maternal vegetal genes that can induce endodermal differentiation. In contrast, Xenf is not induced by endoderm-inducing zygotic transcription factors such as Sox17 and Mix-related genes. In turn, Xenf does not activate expression of Sox17, Mixer or Milk. Thus, Xenf is regulated by maternal vegetal positional information in a parallel manner to Sox17 and Mix-related gene pathways.", "journal": "Mechanisms of development", "date": "2000-03-08", "authors": ["JNakatani", "KMizuseki", "HTsuda", "SNakanishi", "YSasai"], "doi": "10.1016/s0925-4773(99)00274-9"}
{"title": "Identification of a human HECT family protein with homology to the Drosophila tumor suppressor gene hyperplastic discs.", "abstract": "Use of the differential display technique to isolate progestin-regulated genes in T-47D human breast cancer cells led to identification of a novel gene, EDD. The cDNA sequence contains a 2799 amino acid open reading frame sharing 40% identity with the predicted 2894 amino acid product of the Drosophila melanogaster tumor suppressor gene hyperplastic discs, while the carboxy-terminal 889 amino acids show 96% identity to a rat 100 kDa HECT domain protein. EDD mRNA was progestin-induced in T-47D cells and was highly abundant in testes and expressed at moderately high levels in other tissues, suggesting a broad role for EDD. Anti-EDD antibodies immunoprecipitated an approximately 300 kDa protein from T-47D cell lysates. HECT family proteins function as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases, targeting specific proteins for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. EDD is likely to function as an E3 as in vitro translated protein bound ubiquitin reversibly through a conserved HECT domain cysteine residue. EDD was localized by FISH to chromosome 8q22, a locus disrupted in a variety of cancers. Given the homology between EDD and the hyperplastic discs protein, which is required for control of imaginal disc growth in Drosophila, EDD potentially has a role in regulation of cell proliferation or differentiation.", "journal": "Oncogene", "date": "1999-02-25", "authors": ["M JCallaghan", "A JRussell", "EWoollatt", "G RSutherland", "R LSutherland", "C KWatts"], "doi": "10.1038/sj.onc.1202249"}
