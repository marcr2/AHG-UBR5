# --- PARALLEL PROCESSING CONFIGURATION ---
# Optimized parallel processing configuration

RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 0.02  # Reduced from 0.04 to 0.02 for faster processing
REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 30  # Reduced from 60 to 30 for faster failure detection
MIN_CHUNK_LENGTH = 50  # Minimum chunk length for text splitting
MAX_CHUNK_LENGTH = 8000  # Maximum chunk length for text splitting
SAVE_INTERVAL = 1000  # Save progress every N papers

# --- CITATION PROCESSING OPTIMIZATION ---
CITATION_MAX_WORKERS = 1  # Single worker for immediate processing (no parallel needed)
CITATION_TIMEOUT = 5  # Timeout per citation request (seconds) - balanced for reliability
CITATION_BATCH_SIZE = 1  # Process citations immediately (no batching needed)
CITATION_RATE_LIMIT = 0.5  # 500ms between citation requests to avoid overwhelming APIs

# --- VECTOR DATABASE CONFIG ---
DB_BATCH_SIZE = 5000  # Number of embeddings to add to ChromaDB in one operation (max allowed by ChromaDB is 5461)
# Larger values = faster loading but more memory usage
# Recommended: 5000 (ChromaDB limit is 5461)

# --- TEXT PROCESSING CONFIG ---
MIN_CHUNK_LENGTH = 50  # Minimum character length for a chunk
MAX_CHUNK_LENGTH = 8000  # Maximum character length for a chunk
